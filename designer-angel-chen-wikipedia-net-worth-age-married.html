Let’s also explore her age, net worth, married life, and more.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Next In Fashion: Where Is Designer Angel Chen Today?</strong></h3><p>In her Next in Fashion appearance, designer Angel Chen presented herself as&nbsp;a guest designer for Canada Goose and created a capsule collection of 25 pieces for both men and women, with 14 completely new styles. This was back in 2020.</p><p>Fast forward to March 2023, she was just done with her collaboration with coffee brand Nespresso for the Chinese Year of the Rabbit. Together, they launched their “Patchwork Rabbit” collaboration. She also collaborated with the likes of Addidas, H&M, M.A.C., and McDonald’s. And at the same time, she also has been doing well with her brand, Angel Chen.</p><p>During her time in Next in Fashion Angel Chen, fans really loved her pairing with Minju Kim. On the series, they also said they had been friends before the show and had first met in 2015 at London Fashion Scout during a group show. At the time of this writing, it was not known if they are still seeing each other on a regular basis. They also did not seem to have collaborated on any project since. However, they did follow each other on social media. One can see them frequently appearing on each other’s posts during the time between 2019 and 2020.

Her designs have also been stocked at more than 100 international retailers including Lane Crawford, NET-A-PORTER, Galeries Lafayette, Selfridges, Luisa Via Roma, and Urban Outfitters.</p><p>When creating any collection there are a few things Angel keeps in mind. She makes sure they are full of color because she grew up looking at her dad, a color engineer, sitting in a lab and discovering color his whole life. The second thing she insists in the mix of Eastern and Western cultures and the third one is creating a collection that is somewhat genderless and more contemporary.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Designer Angel Chen Age</strong></h3><p>As of April 2022, Designer Angel Chen had reached 30 years of age.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Designer Angel Chen Married?</strong></h3><p>A huge advocator for the LGBT community, designer Angel Chen’s relationship status was unknown as of now. Although, it was clear that she had not gotten married yet.</p><p>While choosing very clearly to not talk about her dating, Angel did not mind talking about her family though. For instance, she told the fashion magazine L’Officiel USA&nbsp;back in 2021 that when she designs or draws, she always thinks about her family. Because she says they give her so much inspiration, and they also kind of taught her all the way through. In addition to being inspired by her dad, she was also always drawn to her mom’s style sense. She recalled hiding in her closet and stealing her beautiful vintage scarf and wrapping it around her body as a young kid. She said that her grandma too is good at lots of techniques, especially sewing and crocheting, and knitting. It was she who taught Angel to sew her first pair of trousers by cutting off a piece of a curtain.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Designer Angel Chen Height</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Beautiful Angel Chen, with looks no less than a model/actress, stands below 5′ 6” in height.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Where Is Designer Angel Chen From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Angel Chen originally hails from Shenzhen, in southeastern China.</p><p>She was only 17 when she moved to study in London at&nbsp;Central Saint Martins.
