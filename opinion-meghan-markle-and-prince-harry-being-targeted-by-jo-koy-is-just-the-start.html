They all do it for their own specials, tours or for big events such as <a href=#>award shows</a>. But what is remarkable is how <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and Meghan were the target of this gag, when not only were they not there, but none of their ventures were on the list of nominees either. It makes the whole ordeal even more sour than the aftertaste left in our mouths after the joke was spilled to millions around the world.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-south-park-all-over-again>It’s South Park all over again</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1391768103-1024x660.jpg><p>Alarm bells are going off inside the Sussexes’ <a href=#>Montecito mansion</a>.</p><p>Cast our minds back to last year, and the royals were subject to a different type of humiliation when South Park focused on the duo in their new season. In an episode called The Worldwide Privacy Tour, they poked fun at <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Harry’s fears over privacy.</p><p>They, shrouded in satire, elaborated on the couple wanting privacy after leaving The Firm but then subsequently writing books and conducting interviews about intimate details about their lives.</p><p>The episode was hailed as ‘brutal’ with hardcore fans of the <a href=#>TV</a> show applauding the humor of it all.</p><p>At the time, sources claimed the couple were considering contacting their legal team over the embarrassment. But, their rep came out months later to rubbish these stories, saying it wasn’t true. Just talk.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-and-harry-being-the-focus-of-jo-koy-s-joke-is-a-much-bigger-problem>Meghan and Harry being the focus of Jo Koy’s joke is a much bigger problem</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1240029639-1024x695.jpg><p>We revisit this, 11 months later, because Harry and Meghan are once again being used as a joke for <a href=#>Hollywood</a> – this time by Jo Koy.</p><p>The comedian made fun of their claims after leaving the royal family and for “asking for money” from <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>. After initiating a discussion over The Crown, Koy praises the talents of actress Imelda Staunton. Setting up his punchline to the gut, he then quickly jumps in to mock the Duke of Sussex.</p><p>Koy said: “How great was Imelda Staunton in The Crown, wasn’t she amazing? Her portrayal of the Queen was so good, Prince Harry called her and asked her for money.”</p><p>Before making the excuse he didn’t write all his own jokes for the event, he then adds in another line for the <a href=#>royals</a>.</p><p>“Prince Harry and Meghan will still be paid millions of dollars for doing absolutely nothing – and that’s just by Netflix!” says the comedian.</p><p>The room erupts in laughter, actors, directors, producers, and the top dogs of Hollywood are left giggling over this one. Twitter and social media were also in fits over this joke, but it does spark bigger warnings for Meghan and Harry themselves after Jo Koy’s brutal swipe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-hasn-t-exactly-gone-to-plan>It hasn’t exactly gone to plan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-13.57.19-1024x517.png><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle is said to be planning a return</a> to Hollywood to revive her old acting career. Before marrying the young prince, she played Rachel Zane on Suits. Between 2011 and 2018, she saw her big break on television come into fruition, before giving it up to work as a senior royal for the monarchy.</p><p>Although, we know how that panned out.</p><p>The Duchess is claimed to be hoping to get her foot back in the door, after the couple’s less successful ventures such as <a href=#>Spotify</a> or Netflix. But if Hollywood is laughing at their attempts of making a buck after being ‘cut off’ by <a href=#>King Charles</a>, what hopes do they have? Are they likely to network well, or taken seriously for potential projects if all of Hollywood’s elite can think about his this perception of Harry ‘asking for money’ and how they <a href=#>aired the royal family’s dirty laundry</a> for a three-part documentary, re-hashing the same thing they told us a year before?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-only-one-way-out-for-harry-and-meghan-and-jo-koy-isn-t-involved>Only one way out for Harry and Meghan and Jo Koy isn’t involved</h2><p>A psychic told CelebrityTidbit <a href=#>Meghan will return to the screen this year</a>, so exciting things could lie ahead. But the 42-year-old told an interviewer on the Red Carpet late last year she’s working on projects behind the camera.</p><p>The duo signed up to lucrative deals after ditching the UK, $100m supposedly from the streaming giant and $20m from Spotify. Although, bombshell author <a href=#>Omid Scobie claimed in his book Endgame</a> this wasn’t the case. He alleged the couple didn’t see most of that cash, as they both agreed to end the contract after an unsuccessful podcast – Archetypes.</p><p>Without another deal in sight, and revelations of how hard it was for Spotify to work with the royals – according to Bill Simmons who worked there – I’m not sure Jo Koy’s joke on Harry and Meghan will have executives lining up to work with them.</p><p>Perhaps Prince Harry needs to get the first draft of Spare 2.0 submitted quicker than he can say ‘The Firm’.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WGcLvPoqWip55iuqazx5qlZqWRp7itsYyapZ1loKe2r6%2FEZp%2BaqqKueqOxyKeeZqyRp7SmwMSdZJuxXZ%2B8brfOsmSiq12fwrTAjK2fnmWjqa6zwI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
