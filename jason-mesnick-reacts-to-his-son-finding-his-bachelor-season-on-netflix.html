But the reality TV alum is unsure whether he should allow his child to watch the ABC show.</p><p>“Let’s pretend YOU were The Bachelor and your 15-year-old son just discovered your season on @Neflix…” Mesnick, 43, wrote in his Sunday, December 15, <a href=#>post on </a><a href=#>Instagram</a>. “Do you: A.) Let him watch it? B.) Ship him off to Switzerland for a few years until it comes off Netflix.”</p><p>The reality star also elaborated on the situation <a href=#>via Twitter</a> on Sunday by revealing that their household was experiencing “a bit of craziness” amid his son’s Netflix discovery. “Ty is going to be 15 in a few weeks and a friend of his told him that our season of the show is on Netflix,” he wrote. “I knew this day would come and it’s HERE!!!!”</p><p>Mesnick became a household name while competing for <a href=#><strong>DeAnna Pappas</strong></a>’ affection on season 4 of <a href=#>The Bachelorette </a>in 2008, but he ended the show as the runner-up. He went on to lead season 13 of The Bachelor, which aired the following year. Mesnik’s run on the dating series is the only Bachelor-related season available to stream on Netflix.</p><p>The Ohio-born star initially chose <a href=#><strong>Melissa Rycroft</strong></a>, but he ultimately <a href=#>called off their engagement</a> to pursue a relationship with runner-up <a href=#><strong>Molly Malaney</strong></a>. They wed in 2010.</p><p>“I mean, you always cringe when you have to talk about it. It’s embarrassing, I think, for everybody involved. That’s not any of our shining moments,” Rycroft, now 36, <a href=#>told Us Weekly in 2016</a>. “But I don’t think any of us would have changed how it happened because we are all where we are supposed to be. I am where I am supposed to be, and I’m with who I am supposed to be with.”</p><p>Mesnick— who shares Ty with ex-wife <strong>Hilary Buckholz-Monrean</strong> —&nbsp; <a href=#>welcomed a daughter named Riley&nbsp;</a>with Malaney, 35, in 2013.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In March 2018, the couple opened up to Us exclusively about <a href=#>their lives together post-Bachelor</a>. “We’re still living in the Seattle area and actually just built a new house about two years ago,” Malaney told Us at the time. “Jason is absolutely killing it in the real estate world and I am the morning show cohost on 106.1 KIIS FM.”</p><p>Mesnick, meanwhile, said his son was a “total teenager” and that his daughter “is as girly as they come.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajmaOku265xKylopubYr%2BmrcKtqmasn2K1qr%2BMrKanZZaeu6W1zaBkoaGjYq%2Bir8eeo6iqXaiyor%2FOp2Sopl2jsrWyy6KvaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
