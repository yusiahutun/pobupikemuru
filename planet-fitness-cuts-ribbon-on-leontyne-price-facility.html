Many travelers to Laurel, who are members of out-of-town Planet Fitness locations, have already taken advantage of the local facility during their visit to America’s “Home Town.”</p><p>“We have plenty of room, plenty of space,” facility manager Skylar Cunningham said. “We also offer a free in-club fitness trainer to work with our members when they come work out, and take it from me — he is phenomenal.”</p><p>“The reception in the community has been amazing,” Cunningham said. “Everyone has been super welcoming and we have really stayed pretty busy each day.”</p><p>The Laurel location features cardio, circuit and weight-training equipment in a judgment-free environment. And to recharge from your workout there are hydromassage beds, massage chairs and the first-of-its-kind-in-Mississippi wellness pod, a fully immersive wellness pod designed to reduce stress, promote relaxation and enhance muscle recovery.</p><p>“We are looking forward to doing more tabling events where we will get out into the community and set up a table at local businesses to meet with folks and let them know what Planet Fitness can offer,” Cunningham said. “We did one at the Knight Butcher a week ago and it went really well.”</p><p>“Planet Fitness has invested a lot of money into this facility,” Chamber of Commerce Director Chris Tullos said. “We could not be more thankful.”</p><p>Laurel’s Planet Fitness is open during the week from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. and from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on the weekends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcLzLmqWerF2btrW6xKyqZpulqcBuvsibmaimXaS7brjEqKWtsZ6aerG%2ByJycZp6RmLattdOyZpqqpJ6wrbG%2Ba2%2BaaGmWf3N5w29ua2VhZrKmecBva3FlkZd%2Fd63DnWluaJGbe6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
