He told Seth Myers it was an “astonishing amount of money” and also said sharing a similar name was “difficult.” Hollander, who is also English, is a big <a href=#>movie</a> star in his own right.

It was while watching the stage production he received <a href=#>Tom Holland’s</a> lump sum.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> explained: “I sat smugly in the audience having just done a BBC show for 30 grand or something which was gonna get me through the next year or so, and I was thinking ‘Well this is marvelous, I’m very prosperous’ …</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Tom Holland reassures fans he’s ‘happy’ after denying Zendaya breakup fears</a></p><p>“And I’m going to go afterwards and see him [my friend] and slightly patronize him and say how wonderful it was. And then the interval came and I thought I’d check my emails.”</p><p>He said when he saw the amount, intended for Holland for his work on The Avengers, his “smugness disappeared” and explained it wasn’t his salary he had received.</p><p>“It was an astonishing amount of money. It was not his salary. It was his first box office bonus. Not the whole box office bonus, the first one. And it was more money than I’d ever [seen]. It was a seven-figure sum.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hollander-often-disappoints-children>Hollander often ‘disappoints children’</h2><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Hollander, 56, explained he found having almost identical names with <a href=#>Zendaya’s</a> beau was “difficult” as “he was here first.” The actor started his career in the early 80s while Holland began his in 2006. Holland shot to fame as the third live-action actor to play Spider-Man but has also starred in blockbusters such as Dolittle and Uncharted.</p><p>Hollander said: “It’s been very difficult, because you know I was here first but he’s enormously famous. I don’t actually get mistaken for him, but in non-visual contexts, I get mistaken for him all the time.”</p><p>He added he will be&nbsp;“excited, then confused, then disappointed children” who expect to meet Holland, 27.</p><p>“They go, ‘My children are so excited to meet you.’ And I go, ‘Are they though?’” the actor said. “They come out and they go, ‘Where is he? Where is he?’ And they go, ‘No. N-no.’”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong><a href=#> Tom Holland adores Zendaya’s new hair and fans can’t cope – ‘This was made for me’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eCcMDOpmShp5yhrq%2Bw0maqnq6Vo3qntcauqZ5lk52ypLeMnqWdnZRiwrF5yKdkmqafqbWmvoyamq2noqh6o63NpGSam5Okwq%2FAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
