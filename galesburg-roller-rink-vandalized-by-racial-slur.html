Someone spray-painted “get out,” followed by a racial slur, on the front of Michael Spinks’ roller rink.
We told you about the Skate Palace last week. Spinks is trying to raise money to repair the rink’s floors and add other amenities. Our Quad Cities News reporter Victoria Frazier reports Spinks isn’t letting this incident derail his plans, although he was caught off guard when he arrived at work on Sunday and saw what someone had painted on his building."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s not welcomed anywhere.”</p><p>Davidson says people in Galesburg will continue to celebrate a Black-owned business that brings the community together, saying she could not believe a racial sur was on a building that welcomes all people, all colors and all ages.</p><p>Galesburg Mayor Peter Schwartzman also reacted to the vandalism. “This action is abhorrent and not reflective of the inclusive and supportive community we have,” he said. “Hate speech will not be tolerated.”</p><p>Spinks says while an issue like this is discouraging, it won’t stop him from achieving his goals for the Skate Palace and the community.</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Spinks said. “It’s just going to motivate me more to get this floor done and get everything else I want to do on this whole corner. I have six acres here to make a dream and that’s what’s going to happen.”</p><p>Spinks isn’t worried about the cost of covering up the graffiti, but more so the principle behind the action.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJ6apJWor7a%2BxmapqKScmr9uvsinomaukaOxorjIs5ydZZKuerOtwqKYpWWjocKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
