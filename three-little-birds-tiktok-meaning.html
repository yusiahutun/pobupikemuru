It's pretty dumb.</h2><p>If you use the popular social media platform then you've probably noticed a conflagration of high-pitched reaction videos of people listening to the same Alvin-and-the-Chipmunks-esque track that caused them some type of trauma. No, there hasn't been a renaissance of that strange early 2000s era of hip-op where comically <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">high-pitched voices were peppered into songs</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Of course people are getting nostalgic over the song (which comes from 2009's Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquell, when The Chipettes cover the song "Put Your Records On" by Corinne Bailey Rae), but to uncover the meaning behind the trend, you'll need to speed the song up to 2x. What happens in the track is that all of the vocals seem to converge to one voice instead of three distinct ones.</p><p>But there's a "dark" theory as to why it converges into just one voice, which Redditor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">moominsoul</a> explains perfectly:</p><p>"According to this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, if you put the song to 2x, it sounds like there is only one voice instead of three. There are other people saying that you can still hear the distinct vocals but yeah, others saying you can't. The childhood part ‚Äî from what I can gather from the comments ‚Äî is referring to Alvin and the Chipmunks. Saying that two of the three chipmunks died. Just being a little dramatic for views basically."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>my life is a fucking mess and all I have stuck in my head is Alvin and the chipmunks singing ‚Äúthree little birds sat on my window and they told me I don‚Äôt need to worry‚Äù over and over pls send help</p>‚Äî kit kat ‚≠êÔ∏è (@slowrushkatie) <a href=#>March 21, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So that's the meaning behind the "Three Little Birds" TikTok.

It sure is, but unfortunately that's the case with a lot of these "deeper" meaning TikTok videos.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Three little birds üëè<br>sat on my windowüëè<br>And they told me I don‚Äôt need to worryüëè aaaahhhhuuhh üëè</p><p>This tik tok sound been stuck in my head all week ü§£</p>‚Äî Brina (@brinalopez98) <a href=#>March 19, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Despite the fact that the trend is kind of cringey, that hasn't stopped a bunch of folks from engaging in it. There are tons of TikTok clips in which people either re-create the "dark realization" as part of the video, or they just play the song because it's burrowed into people's heads like a mental candiru.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>If you aren't familiar with the track in its entirety, then you can check it out below. Is it "ruining your childhood" like so many different TikTok-ers are saying? If you wanted to ruin my childhood then you'd just play the Dinosaucers theme. It's not that I dislike the song, it's just that I can't believe they don't make TV show intros that good anymore.</p><p>Just listen to this terrible "Three Little Birds" track below.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>OK, great, now I want you to listen to the King Arthur and the Knights of Justice intro.
