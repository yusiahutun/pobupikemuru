The lauded producer and songwriter has most likely worked with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://revolt.tv/stories/2017/02/04/heres-list-swizz-beatzs-55-essential-singles-0700a1ff2c data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="some of your faves" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">some of your faves</a> including Whitney Houston's "Million Dollar Bill" and four songs on Beyoncé's B'Day album ("Get Me Bodied," "Upgrade U" "Ring the Alarm," and "Lost Yo Mind"). More recently, he appears on Lil Wayne's upbeat 2018 hit, "Uproar."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition to being featured on other artist's songs, Beatz has also released a couple of albums of his own.

Turns out, they crossed paths as teenagers back when Keys was 16 and Beatz was 17.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"A friend of ours that went to his high school was like, 'Oh you gotta meet Swizz, and Alicia’s about to blow up and Swizz is doing his thing and maybe one day you’ll work together,'" she explained. Years later, she began to see him as more than a friend and found his intellect appealing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think what happened was, he really got me when I saw how far his mind went," she gushed. "He’s really, really intelligent and knows so many interesting things." The singer added that "he knew all this stuff I had no idea about. I think that he loves to live life and he really showed me how to live life in a beautiful way."</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Before they were dating, Alicia Keys found Swizz Beatz "annoying."</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Honestly, I didn't really like him that much.

"Swizz will have the fastest car, the biggest jewelry, the loudest jacket. Everything with him is really over the top. I used to see him and think, 'He is so annoying.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She was so unamused with his antics that she avoided working with the noted producer, but she eventually succumbed. "I fought it tooth and nail. Why should I work with him? Finally, though, we did it and we had a ball," she said.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Beatz's ex-wife and Alicia are tight.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Before becoming Keys' hubby, Swizz was previously married to singer Mashonda Tifrere.
