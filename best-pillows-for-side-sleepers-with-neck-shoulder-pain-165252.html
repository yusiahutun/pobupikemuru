(Stomach-sleepers come in close behind — which is why we rounded up a selection of the <a href=# rel=noopener>best pillows for stomach-sleepers</a>, as well).</p><p>As comfortable as side-sleeping can be, however, it can also cause issues in the neck and shoulder departments. That’s why having one of the best pillows for side-sleepers is a necessity, if you’re among the vast majority of people who sleep on their sides.</p><p>Related: <a href=#>Best Pillows on Amazon</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is side sleeping bad for your health?</h2><p>Side-sleeping has its pros and cons. On the plus side, there are many health benefits to getting your zzzs in this position. According to <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel=noopener href=#>Johns Hopkins Medicine</a>, it can help those suffering from sleep apnea, <a aria-label="acid reflux (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel=noopener>acid reflux</a>, heartburn, and GERD. However, due to the position of certain organs (like your stomach), these benefits only apply if you sleep on your left side.</p><p>On the downside, since sleeping on your side may require resting on one arm (usually tucked under your head), this position can also result in numbness and neck pain —&nbsp;particularly if you also pull your chin down into a fetal position. This position also means placing a good amount of your weight on one of your shoulders, which can lead to additional aches and pains over time.</p><p>As such, it’s very important to be conscious of the alignment of your head, neck, and spine, as well as the overall straightness of your legs and back when you sleep on your side. Luckily, the best pillows for side-sleepers are designed to relieve pressure from the head, neck, spine, and shoulder regions, so you can rest worry-free. For added support with alignment, it can help to place a <a href=# rel=noopener>body pillow</a> between your knees, in order to alleviate pressure on your hips and lower back.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What type of pillow is best for side-sleepers?</h2><p>The best pillows for side-sleepers feature specially contoured designs that help relieve pressure on your neck and shoulders, allowing you to sleep comfortably and wake up pain-free.</p><p>Another key feature? The fill of your pillow. Memory foam is best at evenly distributing your weight, but it can also be heavy and hot. Look for a pillow with breathable memory foam — or even better, one that contains shredded memory foam that can be removed to adjust the height and thickness of your pillow. The more you customize your pillow to your body, the more comfortable it will be, both for sleeping and when you’re awake.</p><p>Now grab a <a href=# rel=noopener>sleep mask</a> and your favorite <a href=# rel=noopener>mattress topper</a> and get ready to drift off in comfort, because we’ve rounded up the best pillows for side-sleepers with neck and shoulder pain. <strong>Keep scrolling to shop our picks!</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>13 Best Pillows for Side-Sleepers</h2><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Power Of Nature Memory Foam Neck Support Pillow</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best cervical side-sleeper pillow</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/power-of-nature-1.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Walmart, $28</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Slow-rebound memory foam fits the contours of your head and neck</li><li>Comes with a hypoallergenic, machine-washable pillow case</li><li>Breathable outer cover</li></ul><p>This <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">memory foam neck pillow</a></strong> was designed to offer neck and head support to side sleepers by eliminating the gap that would typically exist between the neck and the pillow.
