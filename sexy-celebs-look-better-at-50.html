I’d rather scrub a mirror – it does just as much!”&nbsp;</p><p>Once a fan of fads like the Watercress Soup Diet, Liz now takes a holistic approach to nutrition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SMF20AUGCELEBSAT50013.jpg><p>After starting the day with two mugs of warm water, 50% of her diet is fruit and veg, along with lean proteins and no processed food. “I drink little alcohol and I don’t smoke,” she’s said.&nbsp;</p><p>Liz, who is mum to model and actor <a href=#>Damian, 21,</a> doesn’t subscribe to the au naturel look, saying: “I always wear make-up, as I never see the point of looking less than your best.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Celebrity">Read More on Celebrity</h2><p>She says: “I think feeling comfortable and confident comes with age.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Jennifer Lopez, 54</h2><p><strong>How she does it:</strong> <a href=#>The Latina star</a> follows a super-healthy, organic diet, prepared for her by her private chef, as well as drinking lots of water.</p><p>To achieve her famous curves, J.Lo does “fast-paced” workouts, such as boxing and jump squats, with two trainers up to five times a week.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SMF20AUGCELEBSAT50001.jpg><p>She’s adamant she’s all natural, saying in 2021: “I have never done Botox or any injectables or surgery.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Instead, the mum of two relies on adequate sleep and sunscreen, along with products from her own skincare range, J.Lo Beauty.</p><p>She says: “The narrative women are told is that you’re put out to pasture at a certain age.</p><p>"What I’ve found is the total opposite. If you keep working hard, you can be better as a person physically, mentally, emotionally.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Claudia Winkleman, 51</h2><p><strong>How she does it:</strong> Her iconic blunt fringe, liberal use of eyeliner and no-nonsense manner has always given <a href=#>Claudia</a> an air of being younger than she is.</p><p>But the TV star is no fan of exercise, once joking: “I went to yoga once and lasted four minutes. I’m just not that person.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/d7eac71d-11bd-4eaf-bb50-98c0ddb7d0ee.jpg><p>But her <a href=#>Strictly</a> co-host Tess Daly has revealed Claudia avoids caffeine and the sweet stuff to stay in shape, saying: “Claudia doesn’t do sugar. I’ve never seen her eat a sweet.”</p><p>The mum of two has admitted to trying injectables. “I had a go with Botox, but looked both scared and surprised at the same time. I don’t like to be either,” she said.</p><p>She says: “I love being 50. Everything’s falling apart physically, it is like my skin is completely made of crepe paper now, who knew?”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Jennifer Aniston, 54</h2><p><strong>How she does it:</strong> She’s barely changed since <a href=#>Friends</a>, but there’s no doubt <a href=#>Jen</a> works hard to look her best.</p><p>She fasts 16 hours a day, then opts for celery juice, avocados and salmon.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SMF20AUGCELEBSAT50007.jpg><p>Jen exercises most days in her home gym, switching between strength training, resistance bands, kettlebells and Pilates to keep her toned bod in tip-top condition – sharing her workouts with her 42.8m <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers.</p><p>To achieve her A-list glow, she uses an infrared sauna, which increases circulation and reduces wrinkles.</p><p>She also takes a collagen supplement in her morning smoothie.</p><p>She says: “It’s just sort of been a theme in my life: to enjoy the age I am and not look at ageing as a negative, but as the privilege that it is. We all age!”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Kate Beckinsale, 50</h2><p><strong>How she does it:</strong> She recently celebrated her 50th with a wild, celeb-packed bash, but it’s hard to believe Brit <a href=#>Kate</a> is in her sixth decade.</p><p>However, the actress certainly does the hard yards to look so fierce at 50.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/604e40a1-cf40-45bd-be30-a34083c7ee44.jpg><p>She works out six times a week with her PT Brad Siskind at the Gunnar Peterson gym in <a href=#>Beverly Hills</a>.</p><p>Her fitness regime involves a mix of bicep curls, sit-ups, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and, when she’s filming, she always makes sure she packs her yoga mat.</p><p>Kate, who’s recently been linked to actor Matt Atwater and is mum to daughter Lily, 24, has also shot down rumours of cosmetic help, insisting: “I haven’t had a facelift or filler or Botox. I’m not lying.”</p><p>Instead, she attributes her amazing complexion to SPF70 suncream, facials and good genes, adding: “My mum’s got really good skin.” She also eats a healthy diet and avoids alcohol and caffeine.</p><p>She says: “Getting old is f**king great.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Davina McCall, 55&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>How she does it:</strong> Having sold more than 2 million <a href=#>weight-loss DVDs</a>, <a href=#>Davina</a> knows a thing or two about getting fit, especially as you age.</p><p>“Doing any kind of exercise is absolutely 100% going to boost your confidence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SMF20AUGCELEBSAT50006.jpg><p>“It’s really good for menopause symptoms. It’s been my key to confidence. Generally speaking, I definitely feel more confident than I did in my 40s,” the mum of three has said.</p><p>But even Davina has struggled to keep in great shape post-menopause, and has had to adjust her diet accordingly – namely by pulling the plug on post-dinner snacking, after realising she was consuming up to 400 calories by eating carrots and houmous before bed.&nbsp;</p><p>She says: “Getting older is brilliant because you feel happier in your own skin.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Kylie Minogue, 55</h2><p><strong>How she does it:</strong> She’s been Spinning Around the sun for five-and-a-half decades, but <a href=#>Kylie</a> still looks impossibly fresh-faced.</p><p>Prioritising skincare, she religiously applies sunscreen and uses eucalyptus gel as an anti-inflammatory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SMF20AUGCELEBSAT50005.jpg><p>Still, the pop princess has admitted to having Botox and that she’s “tried it all”.</p><p>She also added that, as a woman in showbiz, “you’re damned if you do, and damned if you don’t.”&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, Kylie, who underwent <a href=#>chemo</a> for <a href=#>breast cancer</a> in 2005 before getting the all-clear, has turned her back on tweakments.</p><p>Instead, she prefers to stick to a protein-rich diet, a good work-life balance, and – most importantly – “a cup of good English tea at 3pm.”</p><p>She says: “When I say [my age] out loud, I think: ‘Really? Wait a sec, how? That’s not right!’</p><p>“You have to accept it, even if you don’t feel like accepting it sometimes.</p><p>“But hey, I’m lucky to be here, so it’s all good.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Heidi Klum, 50</h2><p><strong>How she does it:</strong> She hit the big 5-0 in June, yet seemingly has the same body that launched her into supermodel stardom in her 20s.</p><p>But how?
