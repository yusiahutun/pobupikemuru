From random questions to flirty, funny, and personal questions – there is no limit to asking someone some of the best quizzes to amp up entertainment and enjoyment! Plus, this classic game is perfect for all age groups — be it kids, teenagers, or adults.</p><p>Without further ado, let's check out how you can play this amusing game and what questions you can ask to convert any dull occasion into a lively one!</p><h2 id=65c091e6546fc><strong>How to Play 21 Question Game: Process and Rules Explained</strong></h2><p><img alt="How to Play 21 Question Game: Process and Rules Explained" title="How to Play 21 Question Game: Process and Rules Explained" width=1279 height=1144 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-01/1672642779_pexels-kindel-media-7148671.jpg></p><p>You have got an invitation to play a game of 21 Questions. But what is this game, after all? The 21 Questions Game is a game of questions. It is a great party game for people who want to get to know each other better. You can usually start playing this game with at least two people. However, it can be played with as many people as you want – the more, the merrier! Each player asks the other person a question, and the other player answers them. The goal of the game is to answer each question truthfully. The one to answer all 21 questions truthfully is declared the winner. <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>There are only 2 rules to keep in mind while playing this game:</p><ul><li>Firstly, do not repeat the questions. When asking the other person a question, try to be as innovative, funny, and mischievous as you can. Also, it makes the game more enjoyable when the questions are distinctive!</li><li>Secondly, while asking questions, try to be considerate of the comfort level of the other players. This rule is most applicable when you play this game with a group of people and do not share the same level of chemistry with everyone. So, keep in mind that the other player should not feel awkward answering your questions.</li></ul><p>Having a great set of questions at hand that you can ask to anyone, regardless of age and gender is helpful when you want to start an impromptu round of 21 questions. Irrespective of the bond that you share with the other players, you will find something or the other to ask them from the list we have added below. Pivoting a dull get-together into a happening party, these questions will have your friends rolling with laughter or engaging in interesting conversations by the end of the game!</p><h2 id=65c091e654711><br><strong>&nbsp;Simple And Easy </strong><strong>Questions to Ask in 21 Questions Game</strong></h2><p><img alt="Simple And Easy Questions to Ask in 21 Questions Game" title="Simple And Easy Questions to Ask in 21 Questions Game" width=1279 height=853 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-01/1672642965_pexels-elevate-1267697.jpg></p><li>What is your favorite food?</li><li>What is your favorite color?</li><li>What is your favorite song?</li><li>Who is your favorite celebrity?</li><li>What is your favorite holiday, and why?</li><li>What is your favorite fruit?</li><li>What is your favorite season, and why?</li><li>What was your favorite TV show growing up?</li><li>What is your least favorite color?</li><li>Do you like your job?</li><li>What is your least favorite food?</li><li>What do you like wearing often?</li><li>Do you have any pets?</li><li>What is your dream job?</li><li>What are your three favorite songs?</li><li>Are you a night person or a morning person?</li><li>What is your biggest fear?</li><li>What was/is your favorite subject in school?</li><li>Did/do you like watching good morning cartoons as a kid?</li><li>What is your dream destination?</li><li>What are the top 5 things on your bucket list?</li><li>Who is your celebrity crush, and why do you admire them?</li><li>What is that one piece of advice you wish to give everyone?</li><li>What are some of your most <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","21 Questions Game: 101 Best Questions for an Exciting Game Night","1205326","https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/love-relationships/10-questions-you-really-need-ask-yourself-getting-married-440791","articlepage","/lifestyle/relationships/21-questions-game-1205326","special moments in life","Body_Hyperlink","lifestyle","relationships")'>special moments in life</a>?</li><li>What are your top 3 childhood memories?</li><li>Do you believe in astrological signs?</li><li>What is your biggest insecurity?</li><li>Do you believe in mythical creatures?
