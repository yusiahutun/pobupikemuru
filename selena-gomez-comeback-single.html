The singer, 31, released her new pre-breakup track “Single Soon”<strong>&nbsp;</strong>on August 25 — the same day pal <strong>Miley Cyrus</strong> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>also dropped her single</a> “Used To Be Young.” The new tune was the actress’s first song since dropping “My Mind And Me” in November 2022.

While the two haven’t collaborated before, Fred has worked with tons of huge named artists, like&nbsp;<strong>Ed Sheeran, Charli XCX, Shawn Mendes,&nbsp;</strong>and many more. Fans also noticed that the new website: <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>illbesinglesoon.com</a> was registered, and there was a message that asked the glaring question: “Single Soon?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Selena</a> had been teasing that she’d be making her return to music for quite a while. Back in 2022, she shared a TikTok video of herself in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>recording studio</a>, and she revealed that new <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>music was “coming</a>” while she was in Paris back in June. Not long before dropping her comeback single, a source close to the singer revealed to <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>exclusively that she was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“never going to stop”</a> making music. “When she gets inspired, she works on stuff and she’s slowly but surely been creating stuff for her album but there’s no set timeline for anything,” they said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/selena_gomez_comeback_embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>While she’s consistently dropped singles in the past few years, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Selena’s</a> last full-length album was&nbsp;Rare,&nbsp;which she dropped in 2020. Since the album, she has dropped collaborations with tons of huge artists, like Coldplay and&nbsp;<strong>DJ Snake.&nbsp;</strong>She also put out an EP of Latin pop&nbsp;Revelación&nbsp;in 2021. Since putting out her last record, she also starred in the critically-acclaimed, Emmy-nominated comedy Only Murders in the Building&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>Steve Martin&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Martin Short.</strong>&nbsp;Her most recent single “My Mind and Me” was released along with her Apple TV+ documentary of the same name.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Regardless, Selena’s return to the music world is certainly a welcome one. She had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hinted about retiring</a> from music in a March 2021 interview with&nbsp;Vogue.&nbsp;“It’s hard to keep doing music when people don’t necessarily take you seriously,” she said. ”&nbsp;“‘Lose You to Love Me’ I felt was the best song I’ve ever released, and for some people it still wasn’t enough.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Despite hinting that she was thinking about stepping away, she’s put out tons of songs since making those comments, and fans are certainly excited to see her make her return.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5FuZqydnJq7onnGqKSesl2YvK6xwZqapGWjnruouMRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
