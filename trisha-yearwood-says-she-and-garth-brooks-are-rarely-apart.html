If I’m doing something, he’ll be with me, even if you don’t see him, he’ll be in the hotel or around.”</p><p>The Trisha’s Table author even dished the reason why she and her hubby, 57, are so inseparable. “We’re not always together, but we’ve been married before, and we decided we don’t want to be apart. So [we said] let’s make an effort to make sure that’s our priority and we’ve been able to do it,” Trisha said. She was previously married to Christopher Latham from 1987 to 1991 and to Robert Reynolds from 1994 to 1999, while Garth was married to Sandy Mahl from 1986 to 2001.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/garth-brooks-trisha-yearwood.jpg><p>Trisha and the “Friends in Low Places” crooner might be attached at the hip, but they still know how to get on each other’s nerves. However, Trisha said “you have to learn how to argue well.” Which is something that the “How Do I Live” songstress has to work on considering she can get “real hotheaded quick” during a disagreement, while her hubby is “more calm” and “not really an arguer.”</p><p>But while every marriage requires work, Trisha knows she has a good one. “I’m madly in love with him,” she exclusively revealed to <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a> in late January. “We were such good friends for such a long time [before we married], so I think at the end of the day, it’s the friendship and the respect that sustains you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tqaKrmJZ6urHAq66op5RiwKLF0maqoZ1dlrulecaaqa2gXZe%2FsLvKrGSaqpViv6K%2BxKWwZpmglr%2B1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
