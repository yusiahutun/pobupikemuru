We chatted with two celebrity hairstylists to find out.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-coconut-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Coconut Oil?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Coconut oil is a rich, fatty oil extracted from the meat of coconuts,” says&nbsp;Cooper. “It has a very distinctive sweet, nutty fragrance.” In addition to being a superfood, Cooper points out that it’s an antiviral ingredient found in a variety of beauty products—namely, haircare.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benefits-of-coconut-oil-for-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benefits of Coconut Oil for Hair&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Sims, who has worked with America Ferrera, Lupita Nyong’o, and Tracee Ellis Ross, coconut oil is an incredibly beneficial haircare ingredient. “Coconut oil can act as a protective barrier to protect your hair and/or scalp from bacteria and other irritants,” he says. “In addition, coconut oil contains lauric acid, which has a unique ability to penetrate the hair shaft quickly and smooth the cuticle to provide moisture, help heal breakage, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>prevent frizz</a>.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But that’s not all. Cooper says that coconut oil works wonders for amping up the shine. “Dry hair benefits the most from coconut oil use, however, all hair types can use it,” Cooper adds. “The one thing to keep in mind is the amount of oil that you use.” After all, if you use too much, you risk weighing down your hair, triggering build-up, and potentially clogging the sebaceous glands on your scalp.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-use-coconut-oil-for-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Use Coconut Oil for Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sims says that the best way to use coconut oil for hair depends on your mane goals. If you want to use the raw, unrefined ingredient, he says to buy a jar, scoop some out, and apply it directly to your hair from roots to ends, to serve as a hydrating, shine-enhancing DIY hair mask.&nbsp;If you don’t want to deal with that potentially messy situation, though, you can simply update your current haircare routine with coconut oil-infused formulas, like our picks below.<br></p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-groupcallout__title>Coconut Oil-Infused Products</h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-to-avoid-coconut-oil-for-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When to Avoid Coconut Oil for Hair&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As mentioned, coconut oil is beneficial for all hair types, but you have to be mindful of how much you apply. According to Sims, if you have fine, greasy hair, coconut oil can quickly weigh it down and make matters worse. Because of this, Cooper says to start sparingly. “You can always add more if needed,” she says. “[Overall] anyone with a fine hair texture would need to use far less than someone with thick or curly hair.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to how heavily you apply coconut oil (and coconut oil-infused products) to your hair, Cooper says to be cognizant of timing. “Pure coconut oil is heavy and can clog follicles, so do not use raw coconut oil on your scalp as a leave-in treatment,” she says. “Instead, massage the coconut oil into the scalp, leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes, and then shampoo your hair. This will leave your crown with the nourishment given by the coconut oil without weighing down your hair.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions-bcc81ae5-758d-479c-a268-633164ed0f88></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long can you leave coconut oil in your hair?</span></p><p>“If you are using raw coconut oil, you should leave it on your hair for 10 to 20 minutes before washing your hair,” Cooper says. “If you are using a product that has coconut oil as an ingredient, it can be left in the hair until your next shampoo.” (Unless otherwise stated in the product’s directions, that is.)<br></p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Does coconut oil help with hair loss?</span></p><p>Coconut oil won’t prevent hair loss, nor does it regrow hair. However, it does strengthen hair, which leads to less breakage. “The omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E that are found in coconut oil help treat dry and damaged hair, preventing breakage,” Cooper says. “So, it ultimately helps with hair loss by keeping hair hydrated enough to retain length.”<br></p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=3 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Should you put hair oil on wet or dry hair?</span></p><p>You can apply coconut oil however you’d like to. Coconut oil-infused haircare products will have specific instructions. As for raw coconut oil, Sims says it’s best applied to dry hair, as it can better adhere to strands.<br></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqiaqKalqXqwtctmnaiqXZ2uqr6McWxub2Jqfg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
