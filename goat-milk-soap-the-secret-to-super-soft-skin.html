"Along with olive oil and palm oil, goat's milk soap is one of the most widely used natural ingredients."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, we spoke to the two MDs to find out more about goat's milk soap, and all of its skincare benefits.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-is-goats-milk-soap-made></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>How Is Goat's Milk Soap Made?</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All soaps are made by blending a lipid with lye and starting the chemical reaction called saponification. "In the case of goat's milk soap, it's the natural fats in the milk that contribute to the soap formation," says Dr. Ridge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Goat's milk is rich in a lot of helpful fats (specifically caprylic acid) which helps to not only hydrate the skin, but also help remove oil, dirt and skin debris without stripping the protective skin barrier.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-goat-milk-soap-on-the-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>What Are The Benefits of Using Goat Milk Soap on The Skin?</strong></span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>It Has a Similar pH to Human Ski</strong>n</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When it's used for cleansing, it doesn't disturb the skin's acid mantle barrier like other cleansers," says Dr. Ridge. "Disturbing and irritating the skin barrier can set off a cascade of skin inflammation and skin issues because the skin's first response to a foreign substance is to mount an inflammatory response. This is why goat's milk soap leaves the skin feeling so moisturized compared to other soaps, which can leave skin dry and itchy. Because goat milk is so similar to human milk, the skin recognizes it and drinks it in."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The Best Skincare Routine for Acne, According to Dermatologists</strong></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>It Tackles Dryness</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Goat milk is rich in natural lipids, vitamins, fatty acids, minerals and oligosaccharides which can help to nourish the skin's natural microbiome. "When our skin is lacking fat (skin lipids), the skin may appear dry, flaky and easily irritated," explains Dr. Allawh. "For those with eczema and/or dry, sensitive skin, goat's milk soap can be soothing and hydrating."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Ridge, goat's milk is also a source of lactic acid, which gently exfoliates the skin and has been shown to increase production of ceramides. "Lactic acid is also a natural humectant which means that it attracts moisture to the skin, so goat milk soap works by not only attracting moisture, but keeping it there once it's in the skin," he expains.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>It Can Help Fight Acne</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The lactic acid found in goat milk soap has multiple benefits and can also help to fight acne. "Goat milk contains a high concentration of lactic acid, which is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) that helps to exfoliate dead skin and improve dull skin complexion," says Dr. Allawh. "It also helps to unclog skin pores that may contribute to stubborn acne."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>It Can Help With Anti-Aging and Hyperpigmentation</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other than being a great skin cleanser, goat milk soap is also rich in vitamin A. "Vitamin A helps promote healthy skin turnover is important in the treatment (and prevention) of fine lines and wrinkles," says Dr. Allawh. "Topical vitamin A is also helpful in the treatment of hyperpigmentation and helps to even out discolored skin tone."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-skin-type-is-goat-milk-soap-best-for></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>What Skin Type Is Goat Milk Soap Best For?</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Allawh, goat milk soap is good for any skin type. In terms of what skin type will see the most benefits, Dr. Ridge adds that goat milk feeds and nourishes the microbiome, so it calms troubled skin and helps with conditions like eczema, rosacea and psoriasis.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-there-any-side-effects></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Are There Any Side Effects?</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fortunately, there are no commonly occurring side effects known to be caused by using goat milk soap as it is considered less allergenic than over-the-counter soaps, since lacks artificial ingredients and fragrance. However, like any ingredient, if you have allergy-prone skin, you should speak to your doctor or dermatologist and at the very least do a little patch test with the product on the back of the forearm to see if there's a skin reaction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One of the most common questions we get asked is if you have an allergy to dairy or are lactose intolerant, can you still use goat milk soap," says Dr. Ridge. "Lactose intolerance is a condition of the gastrointestinal system caused by a lack of a specific enzyme to digest the milk, and this is not related to the skin." So, if you're lactose intolerant, you can still try out goat milk soap.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shop-goat-milk-soap-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Shop Goat Milk Soap Products</strong></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1onqiZpGK6qrjKZqqomaBiwamxjKycnKqVqXq1u4ysrKmdomLAsLLTZqqkoZ4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
