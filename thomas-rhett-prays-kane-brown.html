"And I want to lift up his drummer, and their family. And I don't know if this is very conventional, but can I just pray? Really fast. Is that OK with everybody?"</p><p><strong>WATCH: Kane Brown Responds to His Drummer's Death</strong></p><p>The audience cheered Rhett's statement, so he continued. "Father God, we love You so much. While also something that we can't comprehend. And so right now I pray that You would be with Kane and his family, and his drummer Kenny and his family, and bring them peace that only You know how to bring somebody."</p><p>Brown's drummer Dixon was just 27 years old when he lost his life in&nbsp;a car crash. Neither drugs nor alcohol are thought to be a factor in the crash, according to authorities. His funeral will be held Oct. 20.
