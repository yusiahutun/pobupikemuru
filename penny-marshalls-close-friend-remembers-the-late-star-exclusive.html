She guided and protected me. I became part of the extended family,”&nbsp;Agnelli, who was like a godson to Penny, told Closer. “Penny did that with people. She took in the birds with broken wings and nursed them back to flight.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/penny-marshall-Giovanni-Agnelli.jpg><p>Agnelli continued,&nbsp;“To this day, I’ve never met anyone that understood people and storytelling in their purest form better than her. Her heart was as big as her talent. I am devastated not only for myself, but for her daughter, and her grandchildren. I love them dearly.” Penny is survived by her second ex-husband, actor Rob Reiner, 71, their daughter,&nbsp;Tracy Reiner, 54, and her five grandchildren.</p><p>Following Penny’s death, her sister, Ronny Marshall Hallin, <a href=#>revealed details of the Laverne & Shirley star’s final moments.</a>&nbsp;“She was ready.&nbsp;She always said, ‘I had a great life,'” Ronny, 80, told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-aesra-score=linkNewWindowWarning:1;>Page Six</a>&nbsp;on Tuesday, Dec. 18. “Penny was great — I loved her.”</p><p>In Penny’s obituary, her family wrote: “Penny was a tomboy who loved sports, doing puzzles of any kind, drinking milk and Pepsi together, and being with her family. Penny was a girl from the Bronx, who came out West, put a cursive ‘L’ on her sweater, and transformed herself into a Hollywood success story.&nbsp; We hope her life continues to inspire others to spend time with family, work hard, and make all of their dreams come true.”</p><p>Penny will be greatly missed by all in Hollywood and around the world. Our thoughts remain with the entire Marshall family during this difficult time.</p><p class=p1>For more exclusive content, sign up for our Closer Weekly&nbsp;<a href=#>newsletter!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46pnKemqWK6or7SoZilpKNisK270p5kn6qZmruledGepJ6lkpq%2FtHnToZxmpJGpsm6%2F05qpZp2omLm2v8ivnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
