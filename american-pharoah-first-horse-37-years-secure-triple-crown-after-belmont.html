Photo: AP" width=486 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>The bay colt with&nbsp;the short tail and misspelt name never looked&nbsp;in any trouble.</p><p>Jumping to the lead, jockey Victor Espinoza&nbsp;controlled the race from the outset, withstanding a number of challenges - first from third favourite Materiality, then from South African raider Mubtaahij, before Godolphin's Frosted loomed up as the fresh horse on the scene at the top of the home straight.</p><p>Within a matter of strides, though, it was over as American Pharoah put daylight&nbsp;on Frosted, with Keen Ice holding down third, two lengths away.</p><p>"That little horse, he deserved it," 62-year-old Baffert said after securing the Triple Crown at his fourth attempt, having missed out with Silver Charm (1997), Real Quiet (1998) and War Emblem (2002). "He's the one that did it. We were basically just passengers."</p><p></p><p>"I was prepared for somebody coming because I've been through this so many times, and I was just hoping I would get it for once.</p><p>"I could tell at the eighth pole (200m mark), it was going to happen and all I did was just take in the crowd. I was just enjoying the call and the crowd.”</p><p>Espinoza had also had his share of near misses, having partnered War Emblem before just coming up short with California Chrome last year, but those were quickly put behind him as he let out a stream of celebratory expletives in the seconds after passing the post.</p><p>"I noticed as soon as I sat in the saddle there was so much power, so much energy," Espinoza said to the waiting media post-race.</p><p>"My plan was to open up a length out of the gate and hit the turn in front by&nbsp;one or two lengths&nbsp;and from there,&nbsp;slow him down and let him be happy.</p><p>"It's so nice to be on a horse like American Pharoah. That was the best feeling I ever had into the first turn."<img alt height=360 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/06/07/_nyc337_50683963.jpg title="The connections of American Pharoah - including trainer Bob Baffert (second from right), jockey Victor Espinoza (second from left), owner Ahmed Zayat (middle) and his son Justin (left) - celebrate the colt's Triple Crown triumph." width=486 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>The finishing time of 2:26.65 was the second fastest recorded by a Triple Crown winner, only behind the incomparable Secretariat, and the seventh fastest Belmont since the race was switched to a mile and a half in 1926.</p><p>Owner Ahmed Zayat is&nbsp;a polarising figure in American racing circles, but the sheer joy and emotion he showed endeared him to a new breed of racing fans.</p><p>"It's not about any of us,'' Zayat said. "I could sit here for hours and praise the job that Bob,&nbsp;Victor&nbsp;and the team have done. But at this juncture it's really about the defining of the greatness of American Pharoah.</p><p>"We all wanted it. We wanted it for the sport. I'm happy for the horse, for the fans. This is about American Pharoah and what does this mean for our beautiful sport?''</p><p>It is likely that American Pharoah will race until the end of the year, with the Breeders' Cup Classic at Keeneland at the end of October a likely swansong before retiring to Coolmore's Ashford Stud in Kentucky. As the only living Triple Crown winner, he is certain to be one of the most sought-after stallions on the planet.<img alt height=327 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/06/07/_aal107_50684007.jpg title="A throng of fans gather to welcome back American Pharoah and Victor Espinoza after the Belmont Stakes.
