According to Hype, fans have speculated that her missed steps were often attempts to avoid contact with fellow group member Rosé.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The two girls are the youngest of the group and have previously said that they often have small quarrels just like sisters. In a deleted scene from the Blackpink: Light Up the Sky documentary, per Koreaboo, the two were shown discussing Rosé’s dissatisfaction over having to give up the maknae position to Lisa when the latter joined. Maknae means “youngest”, and Rosé was the youngest member originally, before Lisa. However, Blinks seem more amused by the “Lisa/Rosé drama” than upset.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/30/f41946a4-3cc5-4395-92eb-3556abcfd866_77e70e99.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hopefully the pair kiss and make up soon, as fans are looking forward to wholesome interactions between all members.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">10 Miss Hong Kong winners from the 1980s – what are they doing now?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Disbandment fears</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/30/22e2d68d-a983-4583-b7ff-c1043629afc9_7390c88c.jpg>Blackpink is set to celebrate its seven-year anniversary in 2023, but with Lisa’s solo music taking off, Jisoo focused on her acting career and Jennie’s myriad fashion endorsements, there are <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">fears of Blackpink breaking up</span></a>.

And although there is no official disbandment news either, many are still worried that this world tour may be Blackpink’s last.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The Born Pink World Tour’s shows in Hong Kong</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/30/541c4686-d046-4a04-9742-fc69d421c83c_8fcf9ae0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Exciting news for Hong Kong Blinks!</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blackpink will be performing for three nights in the city in January.

The tickets originally ranged from US$100 to US$295, while the VIP package including perks such as access to a pre-show soundcheck party went up to US$380. That means that resellers are pocketing quite the wad of cash. The Standard has also reported that, in their bid to secure tickets from resellers, some fans have been scammed out of over US$2,100 for tickets they never ended up receiving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/30/fd354fa2-c7cc-4b00-b0d1-76f5e4300a1b_b80d749b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As this is the first time Hong Kong is seeing Blackpink in four years, it’s no wonder fans are scrambling to get tickets. And although the “Pretty Savage” girls only have 32 songs in their discography, not including solo work, fans can still expect a pretty banger show as the girls haven’t had a single comeback that flopped … That is, if you can get tickets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxpaWlkbn5wrsuamqSomaO4bq%2FOp5qeqqRisKmtzqxkpGWgpL1uvdSenKerXZi8rrHBmpqkZZKkv695z6KlpGWnpL%2BtsIytpq6qXaGur7DSZp%2BoppdiuLC6xmahmqallr%2B6eZFpaWw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
