Your self-esteem shouldn’t be built on whether people are attracted to you, romantically or otherwise. You should see yourself for who you are and recognise what you are good at. Try to identify your achievements and abilities, develop them further, and allow yourself to feel a sense of fulfilment and satisfaction in yourself.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Listen to your heart, especially if it’s telling you to love yourself.

Good hygiene, dressing nicely, eating well, and exercising can improve your self-confidence and make you happy.
