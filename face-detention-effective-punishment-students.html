The emphasis should not be on punishment but changing the students’ attitude towards their studies.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>There are several ways to handle badly behaved students. Most students who face detention are asked to write essays. Other times, they may be asked to engage in activities such as tidying up, or picking up rubbish in their classrooms.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>I believe detention can be beneficial for students because it will help change their behaviour and realise the importance of a good education.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>Which comic character would you want as your principal?</span></strong></a></p><p><h3 type=h3><span type=span><span type=text>Karl Lam, 17, German Swiss International School</span></span></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>I am sure I speak on behalf of most students when I say that detention is a terrible experience that they would never want to face. Some may feel the punishment is shameful and a stain on their reputation. Detention can range from missing lunch breaks to more brutal forms, such as writing pointless sentences thousands of times or serving as a teacher’s photocopying assistant after school.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Detaining students for passing notes in class or not doing their homework might make them feel guilty for maybe a week or so, but it won’t change how they do things. In fact, students who are angry about being punished could cause more problems for teachers and schools as a whole. It’s no surprise that the same people keep getting punished over the course of their student life.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Sitting alone in a classroom after school is no fun. Whether it’s spending time with a teacher to get an important assignment finished, or having a meaningful counselling session with a social worker, more time should be spent on trying to find out why students misbehave and help them correct their mistakes, not punishing them.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>Talking Points: should teachers and principals wear a uniform?</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>What if students who have to go to detention have after-school activities, for example, sports or debating practice?
