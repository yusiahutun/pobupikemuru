I've reached that," she says. "I feel very fortunate to be in that position. But I've sacrificed a lot of things, and I've worked harder than probably anyone I know, at least in the music industry. So I just have to remind myself that I deserve it.”</p><p>"I now know that, yes, I am powerful," she adds. "I'm more powerful than my mind can even digest and understand."</p><p>Jealous yet?</p><p>Knowles also talks about her upcoming Super Bowl gig and how she treats her own performances like football games.</p><p>"One of the reasons I connect to the Super Bowl is that I approach my shows like an athlete,” she says. "You know how they sit down and watch whoever they're going to play and study themselves? That's how I treat this. I watch my performances, and I wish I could just enjoy them, but I see the light that was late. I see, 'Oh God, that hair did not work.' Or 'I should never do that again.' I try to perfect myself. I want to grow, and I'm always eager for new information."</p><p>Check out the pics above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnR7j2pmamhfl7K6u82cnGafoWLAtrzEq2Sbp6eherG0zq2mrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
