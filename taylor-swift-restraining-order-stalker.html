Swift has just been granted a restraining order against the man who is allegedly stalking her.
Timothy Sweet believes he is married to Swift (who recently confirmed she's very much single), and according to legal documentation obtained by TMZ, he will go to all lengths to ensure their 'marriage' lasts.
The 24-year-old songstress has since filed legal documents claiming the man has stalked her since January 2011, flooding her life with emails, letters and social media posts that profess his (scary) love for her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"If anyone in Taylor Swift's family gets killed, it is not my fault," one reads.</p><p>Another claims: "My wife, Taylor Swift (Sweet) and I live in Beverly Hills. I am in love with her. In conclusion, we treat each other with dignity and respect. I will carry a gun to protect her the rest of my life."</p><p>Adds Sweet threateningly, "Dearest Taylor, I'll kill any man who gets in the way of our marriage. Message to John Kerry, Secretary of State. Message from YOUR Presidential Candidate."</p><p>A judge has ordered Sweet to stay 100 yards away from Swift and her immediate family.</p><p>This isn't the first time the successful songstress has dealt with trespassers. This past summer, a 22-year-old fan <a href=#>swam up to her beach house</a> in Rhode Island. Another man <a href=#>jumped over the fence</a> at her Nashville home, trying to gain contact with Swift. She admits that over the years<a href=#> it's gotten worse</a>, but instead of being paralyzed by that fear, she relies on her security team and keeps a positive outlook.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXaeytMDRmqCnoZ6cerC%2Bw56pZquklrmssdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
