I Tested It Out</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-02</div><p>Recently, seeing rave review after rave review of a sex appeal-boosting perfume while scrolling through TikTok instantly caught my interest. Obviously, I wasn’t the only one wondering does pheromone perfume work, since videos tagged with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">#pheromoneperfume </a>have logged over 107 million views and counting on the social media platform. Many ladies who posted videos about using these scents gushed over how the perfume attracted lots of attention from the men in their lives. Being married for 22 years, I thought it would be fun to try one out and see how my own husband reacted. But first, I had a few questions: What are pheromones exactly? Does pheromone perfume work? Could they really get your partner “in the mood”? Keep scrolling to find out just that!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are pheromones?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/GettyImages-916194640-2.jpg><p>In a nutshell, pheromones are chemical signals that emit through the breath or bodily fluids like sweat and urine, etc.&nbsp;that can subtly influence social and reproductive behaviors. “These chemical signals are released by organisms to communicate with others of the same species,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Green, MD,</a> co-founder of anti-aging wellness center <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bywinona.com</a>. “They’ve been studied extensively for their potential role in human behavior, including attraction.” Study after study has shown links between <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pheromones and attraction</a>.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The benefits of wearing pheromone perfume</h2><p>“Pheromone perfumes aim to replicate these natural signals,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kien Vuu, MD</a>, assistant clinical professor of medicine at UCLA, and author of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Thrive State</a>. Ever since 1986, when human pheromones were purported to first be discovered by scientists,&nbsp;perfume companies have been creating synthetic versions of these pheromones to add to perfumes and oils.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pheromone perfume ups attraction and confidence</h3><p>“The purpose of doing so is to trigger attraction,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Annie Liao Jones</a>, niche perfume expert and founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Royal Malady</a>. These pheromones are processed by the olfactive part of the brain, which is also the part of the brain that stimulates sexual arousal. So in theory, wearing these perfumes boost the wearer’s attractiveness and appeal to potential mates by triggering the release of neurotransmitters linked to positive feelings.</p><p>“Also, if you believe wearing a pheromone perfume makes you feel more attractive, you’ll feel more confident,” adds Liao. “Plus, certain scents that are familiar or comforting to others increases the chances of them wanting to be around you more.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/GettyImages-1962238685.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pheromone perfume is a mood booster</h3><p>Best yet, any lucky lady who decides to don these pheromone perfumes can also experience mood-boosting benefits as well. “Some users report feeling more confident when wearing these scents,” says Dr. Green. However, he adds, this could potentially be attributed to the psychological effects of believing they are emitting signals of attractiveness combined with the potential effects of synthetic pheromones, which can contribute to increased attractiveness and reduced stress — sounds a lot like confidence in a bottle!&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, since wearing pheromone products may get you into a relaxed, happier state. you may also feel more open to romantic overtures yourself. “Stress and anxiety can detract from a person’s natural allure,” says Dr. Vuu. “It’s important to note that genuinely expressing emotions and feeling comfortable in one’s skin are very critical components of attractiveness.”&nbsp;By helping to reduce stress for the person who dabs them on, these pheromone perfumes can possibly help to revive a stress-induced low sex drive, which can feel as if libido has increased.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Make Perfume Last Longer: Perfumers Reveal Their Surprising Secrets</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does pheromone perfume work?</h2><p>This all sounds great, but we’ve yet to learn: does pheromone perfume work? “Individual differences in pheromone sensitivity as well as personal preferences for specific smells make it challenging to say exactly how effective pheromone perfumes are,” explains Dr. Green. So the short answer to the original question, “does pheromone perfume work” is that they work differently for everybody. Though the experts we spoke to agree that while pheromones won’t suddenly cause strangers to be instantly attracted to you, they do help deepen the attraction of someone you’re already romantically or emotionally involved with.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>I tried the pheromone perfume and here’s how it went</h2><p>After learning all about pheromones and how they work, I couldn’t wait to conduct my own mini social experiment and see how my husband would react, even though I knew it would be entirely possible that I’d get a non-reaction like TikToker <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Erin Dugan Jurchak</a> did in her viral video shown below about using pheromone perfume. Still, I was excited to roll Pure Instinct Oil (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Pure Instinct, $17.95</a>) on my pulse points — on my wrists, behind my ears and on my collarbone.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@erinduganjurchak href=#>@erinduganjurchak</a><p>🙊🙊🙊<a title=pheromoneperfume href=#>#pheromoneperfume</a> <a title=amazonfinds href=#>#amazonfinds</a></p><a title="♬ It's Been A Long Long Time - Harry James" href=#>♬ It’s Been A Long Long Time – Harry James</a></figure><p>The scent was not what I expected: I’d assumed the perfume would be overwhelmingly musky, but it actually reminded me a bit of the way the sheets would smell after my grandma would hang them out on the clothesline on summer days during childhood. And despite what the doctors had mentioned, I also didn’t expect for my mood to feel so boosted, but I felt really light on my feet. Lastly, I had no idea my cats and my sister’s dog would take such an interest in the scent!&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How my husband reacted to a pheromone perfume</h3><p>However, the biggest surprise was my husband’s response — the pheromone perfume sure got his interest! From coming up behind me while I was doing the dishes, nuzzling my neck to tell me I smelled good or stopping to sit by me while I was reading on the couch, asking&nbsp; if I wanted a “quick cuddle.” The moment that made me smile most was when he paused on his way out the door to his bowling league and asked me if I wanted to see his “follow through.” I couldn’t help but giggle as he wound his arm up as if bowling and finished by coming towards me and patting my rear like a ball before kissing me goodbye.&nbsp;</p><p>Does pheromone perfume work? For me, the verdict is yes, I’d say it definitely worked. And it’s nice to know I have a secret weapon to reach for when I want a little extra attention from the handsome fella in my life. In fact, I plan to toss the roll-on oil into my purse or toiletry bag the next time we manage to get out for a date night or — dare I dream — a weekend away.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The best pheromone perfumes for women to try</h2><p>If you’re eager to try out a pheromone perfume yourself, you may be wondering how to choose the one that’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best for you</a>. Jones says when it comes to picking out a pheromone perfume the most important consideration is to go for base scents that you already find most appealing.
