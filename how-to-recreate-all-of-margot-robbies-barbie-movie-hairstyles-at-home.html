I sure do. The first glimpse of Margot Robbie’s Barbie, donned in a classic black and white swimsuit, white court shoes and matching cat-eye shades, had all of our jaws dropped. But it was her hairstyle which really caught my attention. A seriously high, sleek ponytail. And that retro curly fringe. Just divine.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/a44a99f41470-margot-robbie-swimsuit-barbie-movie.jpg><p id=eQ1aaKY7q1i data-wc=3><strong><u>Get the look:</u></strong></p><li dir=ltr>“To achieve this retro Barbie look,” Kieran says, “I’d begin with sectioning out the front part of your hair, so you have a good amount of hair to create the curly fringe.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Next, you want to grab your paddle brush and sweep the rest of your hair into a high ponytail – the higher the better! Make sure this is super sleek and tight, and use a little gel to ensure there are no fly aways. Working with hair that’s a day or two unwashed will make this a lot easier.”</li><li dir=ltr>“I’d use either Remington’s <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PROluxe You Adaptive Straightener</a>, or a large barrel curler or Air Styler (like the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Hydraluxe Volumising Air Styler</a>) to add some nice curls to the bottom of the pony tail.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Now it’s time for the magic to happen; creating that gorgeous curly fringe. If you’re already blessed with naturally curly hair, then I’d recommend using the diffuser attachment on Remington’s PROluxe You Adaptive Hair Dryer directly onto wet curls. If however, your hair is more on the straight side, I’d use a hair curler which has a narrow barrel, such as the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PROluxe You Adaptive Styler</a>, to mimick those tight ringlets that really give the retro feel.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Secure the look with some hairspray, pop on your sunnies, and you’re good to go!”</li><p id=eRbq9SysvaM data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Barbie movie: all the iconic fashion moments you might have missed</a></strong></p><p id=eo-pL31ViqP data-wc=12><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>There was plenty of Chanel in the Barbie movie, here’s why</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Barbie’s half-up, half-down bow hairstyle&nbsp;</h2><p id=esXtd8NZxJDM data-wc=27>“This is probably one of the most memorable looks from the film, and is a Barbie classic. It’s neat, chic, and super quick to recreate at home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/aa4523ce69ce-95551e1366a615aa61337261bcffdb6a.jpg><p id=euMPL9b1dh_0 data-wc=3><strong><u>Get the look:</u></strong></p><li dir=ltr>“For this Barbie look, we need as much volume as possible. Hair that hasn’t been washed for a day or two will work best. But if you’re working with freshly washed hair, I’d recommend applying a root lifting spray to your roots and blasting your hair upside down to get volume.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Once you’re all prepped, use Remington’s <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PROluxe You Adaptive Hot Brush</a>, to add some gorgeous curls to the hair. I’d also use an Air Styler for the roots, to add a little extra volume at the top of your hair, so it’s even easier to do the half-up, half-down style.”</li><li dir=ltr>&nbsp;“Next, section the top layer of hair that you want to put up, and back-comb underneath it with a fine-tooth comb. This is what really adds that height; creating an almost-beehive effect on the hair.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Make sure the top of the hair is nice and smooth, and using the same comb, I’d pin back the top section of the hair, and secure in place at the back of the head with some bobby pins. If you have a fringe, like Barbie does, make sure to pull these sections out at the front, so you have some framing around the face. You can curve the pieces with a straightener or with your hot brush.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Finally, cover up those bobby pins with your favourite Barbie-bow (I’d recommend pink, duh), and voila – you’re done!”</li><h2 dir=ltr>Barbie’s voluminous bouncy party blow dry&nbsp;</h2><p id=e4Gc2wwqVT7g data-wc=49>“If you’re looking to go full-Barbie glam and hit the dance floor, then her voluminous bouncy curls are the one for you”, says Kieran, “It’s easy to recreate this look at home; all you need is to add some volume to those locks, and a couple of go-to products.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e98814222cfe-17091919-barbie-trailercover1280x720.jpg><p id=edWe8kid4Wuc data-wc=3><strong><u>Get the look:</u></strong></p><li dir=ltr>“To achieve the iconic voluminous ‘Barbie bounce’ in the dancing scene, I’d recommend the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PROluxe Heated Rollers</a> from Remington. Featuring OptiHeat Technology, which intelligently heats both the rollers and the clips in under 90 seconds, these heated rollers create perfectly formed curls, which last all day.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Generally, freshly washed hair is best as some people may get greasy roots after a day or two. However, if you find your hair has more body after wash day then that’s great too.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Once prepped, apply that root lifting spray to your roots and blast your hair upside down to get extra volume. This will help create the perfect base for those bouncy curls. Only smooth the ends a bit with a brush if your hair is very frizzy, otherwise don’t worry too much as smoothing can make the hair flatter. Once blow-dried, start popping in the rollers.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Roll the rollers away from the face at the top of the head for ultimate volume. The best way to achieve this look is to start by piling half of your hair up out of the way from just above the ears. Then you can take sections from the back of your head and pull them over your shoulder to roll up the rollers and secure. You can ‘randomise’ the roll direction through the underneath sections for more natural bouncy movement. Once all the underneath sections are done, release the top sections and put the rollers in rolling away from the face.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Next, allow the rollers to fully cool down before removing, as the heating and the cooling process is what sets the hair in its shape. While the rollers are still in place, add a spritz of hair spray to help set the curls for ultimate bounce factor.”</li><li dir=ltr>“My top tip is to shake your head upside down after removing all the rollers and blast hair with a dry texture/volume spray to add extra hold to your hair, then flip the right way up and shape out with your hands to finish the style. Now you’re ready to hit the disco dancefloor!”</li><h2 dir=ltr>&nbsp;Barbie’s Leaving Barbie Land side plait &nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/72806c93bec4-rev-1-bar-tt3-0059highresjpeg.jpg><p id=eLOL8dbiKLVC data-wc=46>“I’m obsessed with this cute, Barbie side plait. If you want to look put together, but don’t have tonnes of time to get ready; this is just the ticket. It’s really quick and easy to achieve, and looks like you’ve spent loads of time perfecting it.” &nbsp;</p><p id=eTaXWk9nmQnu data-wc=3><strong><u>Get the look:</u></strong></p><li dir=ltr>“Make sure you have some invisible plastic bands to hand for this look.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Start by sectioning the hair into three parts, using a fine-tooth comb, ensuring each piece is equal size.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Pull your hair to the side and braid all the way down, leaving a good few inches unbraided at the ends. Secure with one of your plastic bands (use two if your hair is thick).”</li><li dir=ltr>“Then, gentle pull at some of the braided parts, just so they’re nice and chunky and not too tight – this gives a more relaxed feel.”</li><li dir=ltr>“It’s also nice to pull out some pieces of hair at the front to frame the face, or if you have a fringe, even better. Grab a pair of straighteners (I’d recommend Remington’s <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PROluxe You Adaptive Straightener</a>), and gently curve the pieces away from your face, creating a soft look.”</li><li dir=ltr>“Finally, finish the look off by adding a pretty pink bow to the end of your braid – just like Barbie.”</li><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Barbie’s rollerblading half-up, half-down, with a high pony hair style</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/73268c0b641c-gettyimages-1241583803.jpg><p id=exj2op2uBxoT data-wc=45>"I absolutely love this Barbie look.
