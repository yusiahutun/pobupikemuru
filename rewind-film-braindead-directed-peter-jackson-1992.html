Helmed early in his career by blockbusting filmmaker Peter Jackson, the film is outlandish, at times frightening and always hysterical - a deadpan horror-comedy classic that acts as a blood-soaked tribute to creative filmmaking at its finest.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Wellington, New Zealand, lives mama's boy Lionel, a wet-behind-the-ears man-child living under the thumb of his domineering mother, Vera. One day, while spying on Lionel and his girlfriend at a zoo, Vera is bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey that (naturally) turns her into a bloodthirsty zombie.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And soon enough much of their small town becomes infected, leaving it to Lionel to solve the situation by the only way possible: killing every single one of these undead horrors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like similar laugh-fests and , is a genre send-up. A blood-soaked love letter that loads its 100-plus minutes with scare-conventions turned on their head, before tossing them into a blender and slamming down the "pulp" button.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The result is a hilarious mixture of intentionally bad acting, twisted dialogue ("That's my mother you're p***ing on!") and Jackson's manic directing style. This was his third movie and long before he was granted streams of cash to chronicle J.R.R. Tolkien's works, Jackson was a crazed, bearded man hailing from a small island and armed with ridiculously low budgets that gave him limitless freedom.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">cemented his underground reputation through a passionately inspired filmmaking that is now quite rare in the horror world. Everything in his mind is put on full display: ass-kicking kung fu priests, pus-filled puddings, undead toddlers, full-frontal zombie sex.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It all comes to a red-eyed, fevered crescendo in its final act, as Lionel faces a never-ending swarm of zombies, armed with a chainsaw: blood flows, guts spill, limbs fly and brains splatter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jackson's trilogy is now lurching its way to the finish line in cinemas: it's child-friendly and far from the sadistic thrills of his early efforts. But instead of forking out hundreds of dollars for some fantasy-filled 3D fest, take a journey into Jackson's past gory (sic).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHKClW5rbW1fp7K4tc2dZJ%2BhnKJ6o77AoqWdnZGZeqW10Z6arZ2UYr2mwMSrZKOZk6DAsLqManByag%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
