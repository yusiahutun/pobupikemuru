Roll back the clock to October 24, 2016. It's Budapest CH. Medvedev is a sprightly 106 in the rankings, while Rublev, still wet behind the ears, is far down at 167."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In the story of Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev, we witness a saga reminiscent of the Celtics vs. Lakers, only the court here is very different. Their clashes echo those age-old stories of rivalries, the Larry Birds to Magic Johnsons of tennis.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Roll back the clock to October 24, 2016. It's Budapest CH. Medvedev is a sprightly 106 in the rankings, while Rublev, still wet behind the ears, is far down at 167. It's like watching a young Jordan figuring out the nuances of the game, with Medvedev beating Rublev 6-3, 6-2. In hindsight, it feels like we were watching Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr before their infamous duel. Except here, both survived and lived to battle many more times.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>2019 rolls around, and the scales have tipped a bit. At the Cincinnati Masters in August, Medvedev, with a rank of 8, is no longer the rookie trying to prove himself. He's the young prince knocking on the doors of the kingdom, and he meets Rublev, still punching above his weight at rank 70. It's like watching Rocky face off against Drago, except both fighters are from Russia, and spoiler alert: Rocky wins this time. Medvedev knocks Rublev out, 6-2, 6-3.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Just a month later, the ballet unfolds again, this time in St. Petersburg. Remember "The Godfather"? That scene where Michael Corleone tells his brother, "It's not personal, Sonny, it's strictly business"? This is that scene. Medvedev, ranked 4, solidifies his reputation as the godfather of Russian tennis, with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Rublev, ranked 38.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Flash forward to 2020's US Open. If Medvedev and Rublev’s rivalry were a TV series, this would be its Season Finale. Here they are again, the Obi-Wan and Anakin of tennis, ranked 5 and 14 respectively. Medvedev, in a majestic performance that reminded me of Tom Brady’s surgical dissection of rival teams, outclasses Rublev in a closely fought match, 7-6(6), 6-3, 7-6(5).</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>2021 seems to tilt the favor towards Rublev for a while. In a twist that George R.R. Martin would've penned, our underdog makes a stand. At the Australian Open, with Medvedev at rank 4 and Rublev close at 8, it was supposed to be Rublev’s time. But, no! Medvedev snatches victory from the jaws of defeat: 7-5, 6-3, 6-2. Yet, Rublev does have his "Red Wedding" moment at the Cincinnati Masters. Ranked 7, he pulls off an upset over Medvedev (now the world number 2), with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 win. It’s like watching Leonardo DiCaprio finally winning his Oscar. Except, instead of fighting a bear, Rublev’s wrestling with a Russian bear of a different kind.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>2022 gives us the Tour Finals, an encounter to remember. It’s the tennis equivalent of ‘Avengers: Endgame’. Medvedev at 5, Rublev at 7. And in a 3-set thriller that I can only compare to Ali vs. Frazier's Thrilla in Manila, Rublev bests Medvedev: 6-7(7), 6-3, 7-6(7). The match had more twists and turns than a Scorsese mob movie.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Now, 2023. Dubai. It's like we've come full circle. Medvedev, world number 7, against Rublev, world number 6. It’s like watching the final season of ‘Breaking Bad’. You know someone’s empire is about to fall, but you’re not sure whose. Medvedev seems to say, “I am the one who knocks,” as he decimates Rublev, 6-2, 6-2.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>So, what’s the count? In their epic tête-à-tête spanning seven years, Medvedev leads 6-2. While Rublev has shown sparks of brilliance, reminiscent of an underdog story, Medvedev’s surgical precision and icy demeanor have often been his trump card.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Their rivalry is akin to the tale of Achilles and Hector. Two warriors, at the top of their games, battling for supremacy. Only, they both get to live to tell the tale, and we, as mere mortals, can only sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the show.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>To Rublev, a small piece of advice – watch out for that heel, buddy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufony1sc2noKxnnZqxt7HDnq1mrqNiv7auy56tZqCVlrFuwM5mn56ZlGK%2Fpr%2FUpaus</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
