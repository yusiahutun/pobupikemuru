His relationship with his girlfriend Monique Robinson is one of the relationships the show chronicled.</p><p>Through a Facebook forum for inmate pen pals, Monique met Derek. Upon seeing Derek’s picture, Monique was compelled to message him. In one video, Monique described how she came into a jail pen pal group while just scrolling through Facebook because it was late and she couldn’t sleep.

She also admitted to her pals that when Derek gets released from prison in a few days, she is worried about what he will think of her when they first meet. Monique clarified to her pals, “I’m nervous. It does cross my mind, like what if, you know, I’m not what he imagined, or what if he [doesn’t] like me? I’m trying to think positive, but it’s hard when y’all are being so negative.”</p><p>People who viewed the new season’s episodes were quick to claim that Monique catfished Derek. Soon after, Monique joined the conversation on Instagram to address the catfish charges. She wrote, “Now I done let y’all play with me on this internet long enough. I hate how Love After Lockup trying to push this narrative like I’m catfishing a man in prison. I use filters on pics like every other woman. Also, I gave y’all plenty of pics to choose from when y’all did my intro and y’all did not use ONE full body pic.”</p><p>She added, “Why is that??? Like I was sending nothing but filtered selfies for 2 1/2 years? 🙄 be fuckin fr!! I’ve always been a confident BBW. Y’all cannot bully me or fat shame me because I know who tf I am!!
