Edwards co-founded Nitro Circus’s touring arm in 2009 and served as COO and a board director before becoming president two years ago.
The company was founded in 2003 by motorsports personality Travis Pastrana. It now contains media production, touring, sports competition and consumer products.
“Thinking back to where Nitro Circus started – a few crazy friends filming each other in our back yards and editing out of a garage in Utah – to now, where we have the opportunity to work with the best camera crews, editors, ramp builders, riders and logistical geniuses in the business, creating events that are seen live around the world, it’s a dream come true,” Pastrana."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
