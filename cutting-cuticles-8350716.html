"I'm not anti-cutting-cuticles when it's done properly," says celebrity manicurist Julie Kandalec, weighing in on the debate. "Personally, I use the term 'trim' instead of 'cutting' when it comes to cuticles. Because that's really all someone needs."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to learn everything there is to know about cuticle cutting.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-cuticles-are-important-to-nail-health></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Cuticles Are Important to Nail Health</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>"Cuticles serve several important purposes for your nails and fingers," says Dr. Banta. They serve as a protective barrier from infectious agents like bacteria and fungi, help to regulate moisture in the nail bed to prevent nails from becoming brittle and dry and support healthy nail growth. Additionally, cuticles also have nerve endings that make them sensitive, helping you avoid injuries by making you aware of how much pressure you're applying to your nails and fingers.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-reasons-for-removing-cuticles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Reasons for Removing Cuticles</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Sometimes, trimming cuticles really is necessary during a manicure to ensure proper adhesion of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nail enhancements</a>," says Kandalec. Plus, when cuticles are super overgrown, they can take up valuable real estate on your nail bed, shrinking the amount of room available for polish.</p><p>It's important to note that when cuticles are removed, you have to be gentle and as conservative as possible<strong> </strong>to ensure there is enough cuticle left over for them to serve their purpose.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cuticle-cutting-risks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cuticle Cutting Risks</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Just like anything, when done properly by a professional with sterile tools, cutting cuticles is fine," says Kandalec. Note her use of the word professional—without proper education and technique, it's really easy to cut off too much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Cutting cuticles completely causes an opening, which can create an entry for bacteria and other organisms, increasing the chance of an infection," says Dr. Marisa Garshick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, over-cutting cuticles can disrupt the natural growth pattern of your nails and "can lead to ingrown nails that can cause pain, swelling, and potential infection," says Dr. Banta. "Improper cuticle cutting can result in chronic cuticle damage, affecting the appearance of your nails and causing the surrounding skin to become rough and irritated and more susceptible to infection."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-safely-remove-cuticles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Safely Remove Cuticles</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1. Soften Cuticles</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Cuticle-removing creams offer a good option to help reduce their appearance without leading to irritation," says Dr. Garshick. "Creams can also help to soften the cuticles, which can be helpful for someone who prefers to avoid having cuticles looking dry or cracked."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kandalec says the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Deborah Lippmann Cuticle Remover</a> ($22) is a great option.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Deborah Lippmann</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have always done a dry manicure, which starts by using a cuticle softener like the Deborah Lippmann and never [includes soaking nails] in water," she says. Dry manicures are often considered safer than wet manicures because the cuticle can't be over-softened in a way that yields over-cutting.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2. Push the Cuticles Back</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Using a clean tool, you can push back softened cuticles and then clean them with a cotton round. "Pushing cuticles back helps to maintain the natural barrier and protects the base of your nail," says Banta. "This helps to minimize and prevent the risk of infections and, in turn, helps to support nail growth and maintain the natural structure of the nail." Still, you have to be gentle and avoid being too aggressive as you push.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a salon, a manicurist may also use an e-file to remove excess cuticle skin. "For the past three years, I have been doing 95 percent dry manicures using e-file and extremely fine diamond bits to exfoliate the dry skin, so the need for trimming (or cutting) at all is little to none," says Kandalec.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>3. Trim the Cuticles</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the cuticles are softened and pushed back, you should have a pretty clean canvas. But if you're confident in your judgment (or that of your manicurist), you can go forth with a little trim. Use sterile snippers, and take care to remove only extra grown-out bits so the base of your cuticle remains intact and in action.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wq6rraGenHqkwdOimqWdo2KFdIGPcGhv</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
