In 1994, Melissa landed a main role on </span><i><span>Sweet Justice</span></i><span>, an NBC legal drama that lasted one season. The television personality returned to her roots in 2009, portraying Caroline “Ma” Ingalls in the </span><i><span>Little House on the Prairie</span></i><span> musical that toured across the U.S.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 2012, the Emmy nominee took her talents to the ballroom to compete on season 14 of </span><i><span>Dancing With the Stars</span></i><span>. She finished the competition in fifth place. Three years later, Melissa landed a recurring role on </span><i><span>Secrets and Lies</span></i><span> but the series was canceled after two seasons. In 2021, she joined “Marvel Wastelanders: Black Widow,” a scripted podcast directed by her husband, </span><a href=#><b>Timothy Busfield</b></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Timothy, also an actor, and Melissa got married in 2013.
