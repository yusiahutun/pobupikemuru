But if they did, here’s how it would pan out according to the research team at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Booking Agent Info</a>, who gathered the streaming data.</p><p><strong>Record of The Year –</strong> Miley Cyrus – Flowers, with 1,736,263,932 song streams.</p><p>SZA comes in second place with 1,626,565,693 streams of Kill Bill, with <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> in third for Anti-Hero with 1,366,764,290 streams.</p><p><strong>Album of The Year </strong>– SZA – SOS with 6,703,946,765 album streams in total for all songs.</p><p>The same three once again dominate this category on Spotify, with Taylor in second for Midnights with 6,422,331,274 steams. Although Miley Cyrus’ Endless Summer Vacation is in third, it’s miles behind the top two, with 2,463,891,310 album streams in total for all songs.</p><p><strong>Best New Artist </strong>– Noah Kahan with 35,259,890 monthly listeners.</p><p>In terms of listeners, Noah would be closely followed behind by Ice Spice, with 24,700,394 monthly listeners.</p><p>However, as we know it’s not the Spotify Listeners who determine the winners, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens tonight.</p><p>SZA leads the way in terms of nominations with a staggering nine. One of these is Best Album, alongside Swift. The Love Story singer will become the first artist to win the prize for a fourth time, should she win.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1817411068-1024x682.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-won-t-be-performing-at-the-grammys-but-here-s-who-will>Taylor won’t be performing at the Grammys – but here’s who will</h2><p>Although rumors were flying about that the Cruel Summer singer would be performing at the event, these have since been shut down. However, fear not, she will still be in attendance, and viewers have an amazing lineup to look forward to.</p><p>Performing at the Crypto Arena will be SZA, Burna Boy, <a href=#>Billie Eilish</a>, Billy Joel, <a href=#>Dua Lipa</a>, Olivia Rodrigo, and Travis Scott.</p><p>Although Taylor will be in attendance, unfortunately, we won’t be getting the first Red Carpet pics of her and <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a>. The NFL star recently revealed he would not be able to attend due to <a href=#>training for the Super Bowl</a>, taking place in Vegas on February 11.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WBcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02auqK2cmbu1edKwnJ6oXam1pnmRaWltZZenrq652Kxkop5dqL2wwMifsGakmajBprrEq6pmrp%2BpsqV5w5qrmmWjqrSosdKtqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
