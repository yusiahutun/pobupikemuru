"Meez Nation's users are big music fans, so giving them the ability to rock out together, listen to new music and just hang out in the band's branded rooms is just incredible," said Sean Ryan, CEO of Meez. "Meez Nation is seeing tons of traction since launch, with users staying for an average of 52 minutes per visit, and we anticipate fans will spend days hanging out in the AEG Live Tour Mansion. We will add more bands to this mansion as our AEG relationship expands." Meez Nation is designed to let everyday users easily connect with others and share experiences. Residents can chat with one another, watch YouTube videos together, listen to music and leave answering machines messages. By typing various text triggers such as "LOL," "OMG" or "dance," Meez users can launch animations to amuse others in Roomz. There are also numerous interactive objects spread around Meez Nation to inject fun into the scene, including walls that can be tagged with graffiti and a Tesla coil that zaps users. –by CelebrityAccess Staff Writers</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGillZrHbrrAraCopl2Xwqq4w6xkmmWdlru0tc6nZJ%2BnomKuprOMpaCvnV2pvLa%2ByKeeaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
