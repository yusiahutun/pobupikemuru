Chip had his arm resting across his wife's shoulders, while she wrapped her arm around his waist. The couple beamed for the camera as they took in the momentous moment together, with Joanna captioning the romantic photo: "20 years of Summer love."&nbsp;</p><p id=ep8fiK9dUd data-wc=51>Joanna and Chip live in a 1,700-square-foot Victorian home in Crawford, Texas, a suburb of Waco, that sits on 40 acres and has more than enough space to house their large family, which includes their five children Duke, 18, Drake, 15, Ella Rose, 16, Emmie Kay, 14, and five-year-old son Crew.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eEg9Lmudb3 data-wc=49>Waco holds a special place in the couple's hearts as it is also where they tied the knot two decades ago at the Earle Harrison House. Last year, Joanna reflected on their happy day and said that one of her fondest memories is the moment she got to eat.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ba1f89a1613e-joanna-chip-gaines-anniversary.jpg><p id=eGVVCJoV5we data-wc=59>"My favorite moment is when we said goodbye to everybody, got in the limo and ate so much food!" she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a>. "I just remember, when we got there, I saw how good the food looked and I asked my mom, 'No matter what, will you just put some food in a container and put it in the car?'"&nbsp;</p><p id=evDMq3beahn data-wc=70>She continued: "So we did our thing, we did our dance, we did all the things that you're supposed to do at a wedding. And all I kept saying is, 'I can't wait to be in that car with Chip headed to our honeymoon'. And the second that door shut, I was like, '<strong>Thank God, this is why I'm here. I just wanna be with you and I wanna eat.'"&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/44d5288770a0-joanna-chip-gaines-anniversary.jpg><p id=eIZtMD3F2YL data-wc=67>Joanna added: "Weddings are kind of scripted and you're doing a lot. You can forget why you're really there. And for me, I was really there because I wanted to be with Chip<strong>. It will always be my favorite memory — when that limo door shut, and we just ate like kids with our hands.&nbsp;</strong>It was Beef Wellington, mashed potatoes, and two different kinds of cake."</p><p id=e50HlMwz69f data-wc=53>Chip proposed to Joanna in 2002 after a year of dating, although it wasn't quite the traditional proposal. He popped the big question in a shopping center without a ring, instead taking her to a friend's jewelry store inside the mall after she said 'yes' so she could design her own engagement ring.&nbsp;</p><p id=eylFlDc0H1 data-wc=52>Their marriage hasn't all been plain sailing though. In a personal essay published in the <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Magnolia Journal&nbsp;</a>last year, Joanna said there are many obstacles she and Chip have had to overcome. "In our 20 years of marriage, Chip and I have experienced a little bit of all of it," she wrote.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMEew92FDr_ data-wc=46>"Losing a loved one. Shifts in friendships. Bills we couldn't pay. Moments where our hearts were broken. Times when all hope felt lost, and circumstances were out of our control. When all I could think to do was lay face down on the floor in surrender."</p><p id=eMuSusaZrfe data-wc=31><strong>Get the lowdown on the biggest, hottest celebrity news, features and profiles coming out of the U.S. <a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our HELLO!
