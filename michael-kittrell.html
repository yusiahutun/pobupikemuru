Michael’s mother left the house one evening, and she never came back.</p><p>Later, the family discovered she had been hit and killed by a car.</p><p>Michael has since been raised by his grandmother, Mema. Michael attended Grayson High School.</p><p>Michael’s career all started on January 14th of 2010, when he was just 17 years old. Michael, a young man with a pale complexion and bright orange hair, posted a video on YouTube titled “GINGERS DO HAVE SOULS!!.”</p><p>In this video, his brow furrowed, he rants and raves about how the animated show South Park’s negative portrayal of ginger people caused him to endure severe bullying in real life.</p><p>The video went viral overnight!&nbsp;</p><p>A little while later, after posting a handful of rant-style videos to his YouTube account “CopperCab,” Michael posts a video titled “DEAR SOUTHPARK..”</p><p>Apparently, after his initial “GINGERS DO HAVE SOULS!!” video, the animated show created an episode depicting a parody character blatantly mocking Michael’s angry, red-haired demeanor.</p><p>In “DEAR SOUTHPARK..”, Michael demands the show to stop portraying redheads in a negative light.&nbsp;</p><p>Michael’s channel continued to grow as he kept posting videos as “the angry ginger” (which he hates to be called). South Park has released several episodes involving their own angry ginger character.</p><p>Michael’s channel evolved into quite the community! He has now somewhat renowned for being one of the biggest internet trolls of all time.</p><p>Michael even produced some music throughout his stardom.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-45569 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Michael-Kittrell-net-worth.jpg.webp alt="Michael Kittrell net worth" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Michael-Kittrell-net-worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-45569 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>His 2014 debut song was titled “Gingerbread” and was funded by Knockout Entertainment (Ray J’s record label).
