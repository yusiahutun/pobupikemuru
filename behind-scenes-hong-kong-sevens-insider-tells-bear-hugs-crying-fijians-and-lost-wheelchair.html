Paradoxically, this may be one of the most satisfying moments for me. The teams in the final had no idea!

I look forward to seeing people I haven’t seen in years, typically coming out of the throng. I think my takeaway memory of the 2022 Sevens (first since Covid-19) was the intensity of bear hugs. It showed how much people had missed us.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/11/05/7s_clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:30</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Hong Kong rugby Sevens a test of city's readiness to reopen after years of Covid restrictions</p><p>Hong Kong rugby Sevens a test of city's readiness to reopen after years of Covid restrictions</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some favourite Sevens faces, though: Jonah Lomu, David Campese, Waisale Serevi, Christian Cullen, Eric Rush, Chris Handy, Sean Fitzpatrick, Osea Kolinisau, Jean de Villiers, DJ Forbes, Brent Russell, Paul True, Sir Gordon Tietjens, Pat Lam, Brian Lima, Lorna Meads, Beth Coalter, Warrick Dent, Mike Friday, Keith Quinn, Graham Eden, and some of the world’s most incredible sports hacks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/11/05/7s_clean.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Any strange requests over the years?</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There was one year I remember a Sunday night, hours after play, hunting around the stadium with [Hong Kong China Rugby CEO] Robbie McRobbie for someone’s wheelchair. I thought it was an April fool’s prank, but it was a legitimate mobility aid, not a costume or anything, and this gentleman somehow misplaced it.
