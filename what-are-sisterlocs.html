What are Sisterlocs?   &#34;Sisterlocs are tiny locs that are created using a tool and an interlocking technique,&#34; explains Dr. Kari Williams, the creator of goddess locs. &#34;The small size of the loc differs from traditional locs that are formed using a twisting or palm rolling method and are typically larger in size."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You should avoid conditioners — at least in the beginning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Use clarifying shampoos that will gently remove dirt and smells from the hair," she explains. "During the budding stage of the loc process, you want to avoid using conditioners and products that will soften the hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, she still recommends using water-based moisturizers and natural oils to keep hair and scalp hydrated once the locs have set.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-sisterlocs-cause-traction-alopecia></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can Sisterlocs Cause Traction Alopecia?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like any form of manipulation, sisterlocs can cause traction alopecia if the hair is not cared for properly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Locs gain weight over time, so it's important that the base of the loc is strong enough to manage the weight of the locs as they get older," the expert explains.

"But I would recommend being careful not to add too much weight to the loc.

But the biggest difference is the the installation. Sisterlocs must be installed and maintained by a professional technician. Sisterlocs have a very specific "grid" that takes into account your hair's texture and density so all of your locs are formed evenly, while braidlocs can take a more freeform approach.</p><p>Also, sisterlocs are incredibly expensive to start, while braid locs can be easily started by simply braiding the hair.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions-ee8b50af-f1ea-483e-939b-934a2a93bb1f></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=49><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How much does it cost to start sisterlocs?</span></p><p>Sisterloc installation can vary in price depending on your location, your loctician, as well as the length.
