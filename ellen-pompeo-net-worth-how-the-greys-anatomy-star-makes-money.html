After doing some commercial work, Ellen made her television debut as a guest star on&nbsp;<i>Law & Order</i>&nbsp;in 1996. Her first film appearance was in a 1999 movie called&nbsp;<i>Coming Soon</i>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Her career stayed steady with smaller roles in movies like&nbsp;<i>Moonlight Mile</i>,&nbsp;<i>Catch Me If You Can</i>,&nbsp;<i>Old School</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Daredevil</i>. However, she blasted to superstardom with her starring role in&nbsp;<b>Shonda Rhimes</b>’&nbsp;<i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>, which premiered in 2005. Ellen’s success hit an all-time peak when she became the highest-paid actress of 2013.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Since then,&nbsp;<i>Grey’s</i>&nbsp;has become the longest-running primetime medical drama in history and outlasted&nbsp;<i>ER</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>M*A*S*H</i>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Does Ellen Pompeo Own Any Businesses?</h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ellen, who is <a href=#>married to&nbsp;<b>Chris Ivery</b></a>, didn’t stop with acting. In 2011, she launched her own production company called Calamity Jane. The Massachusetts native also became a coproducer for the spinoff series <i>Station 19</i>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The <a href=#>mom of three</a> said being “positive” is one of her secrets to success. “[Successful people] don’t start a sentence with ‘You can’t’ or ‘I don’t know how. They simply ask, ‘How do we do it?'” Ellen explained during an appearance on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Good Morning America</i></a>&nbsp;in 2018. “You have to find a way to get it done. Life is problem-solving, and if you’re good at problem-solving and finding an alternate route, you’ll keep on your path.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The SAG Award winner noted that obstacles are bound to happen, but it’s important to keep moving forward. “If you see one stone in your path, fall over it and cry in the corner, guess what? You’re not walking down the road,” she continued. “But you trip, get up, throw the rock away and keep walking.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>All in all, Ellen’s advice is straightforward: “Stop worrying so much about what other people think of you.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46eo6WdnmK9sLnPnqZmppWperi70a2fZqCfrHq1tMRmnqudqah6orrAraamsV2owaK%2BjKaYpJ2jYrqwusSyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
