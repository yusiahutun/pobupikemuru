Toomey, 27, was originally going to have to return to her native Australia (she lives in the US now) for a semi-final, but CrossFit tweaked its qualification structure for the semi-finals, letting her and a few other notable athletes avoid having to travel due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Poland’s Gabriela Migala finds CrossFit peace off Spanish coast</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Toomey was followed by Haley Adams and Brooke Wells, both of whom also made the final five for the 2020 games.
