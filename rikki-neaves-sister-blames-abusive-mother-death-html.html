class=mol-para-with-font>It was originally thought that Rikki could have been killed in a similar case to that of tragic James, who was abducted, tortured and murdered, aged 2, by 10-year-old boys, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, in Kirkby, Merseyside, in 1993.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Neave then became the key suspect, and was charged with her son's murder in 1996.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the trial hinged on the evidence of a policeman who searched the woods where Rikki would later be found.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the time he found nothing, with prosecutors claiming the officer had initially missed the body because it was dark.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was claimed the body had been washed of vital evidence in the time it took to find it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A judge ordered a jury to acquit Ms Neave if they believed his testimony, because it meant she would not have time to have moved the body after that point because the police were already with her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After being found not guilty of murder at trial, she later admitted cruelty towards her son.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Earlier in Watson's trial the court heard Ms Neave say she had been 'bullied into' pleading guilty to the abuse charge and 'did not know' what she was pleading guilty to.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The prosecution heard that Watson, a child from a broken home, had murdered Rikki in the woods before midday on November 29.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rikki had been heading to his school, Welland Primary School, that morning, alone, having had a bowl of Weetabix earlier this morning.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Watson, the court heard, who was living at Woodgate's Children's Home at the time of the killing, was likely to be bunking off from Walton School in Peterborough on the same day.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The court heard that Watson knew the Walton estate well as he had spent time there as a young child and his father still lived there.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is believed he and Watson met on that day, with witnesses telling the jury they saw the pair walking in the direction of the woods, where Rikki would later be murdered. Watson then returned to Woodgates Children's Home that afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>John Price QC told jurors at his Old Bailey trial: 'We suggest the evidence has been placed before you to enable you to finally resolve who it was who did it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We ask you to declare by your verdict that it was James Watson who murdered Rikki Neave.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The prosecutor said that while the case was 'circumstantial', there was 'no 'only' about it', adding: 'Circumstances do not lie.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Price suggested that Rikki's last meal of Weetabix put his time of death at around midday on November 28, shortly after he was seen with Watson.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mud on Rikki's Clarks shoes indicated he walked into the woods and did not walk out again, the prosecutor said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Price gave jurors a detailed analysis of alleged 'ghost sightings' of Rikki later that day, saying those witnesses were 'mistaken'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Watson was interviewed during the original investigation into the murder but 'did not mention' to police that he had physically 'picked up' Rikki on the day he died.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Watson's lawyers called defence witnesses who all claim to have seen Rikki on the evening of 28 November.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Local man Stuart Duffy, who was known locally as 'Jingle Bells' because he used to wear bells on his boots, insisted he saw and spoke with Rikki that Monday evening.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In her closing speech Jenni Dempster, QC, defending Watson, told the jury there were several routes to reaching a not guilty verdict.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The first was for the prosecution to establish Watson's guilt while the second was the 'wealth of evidence' suggesting Ruth Neave was responsible for Rikki's death.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Dempster said the evidence that the prosecution have against Watson 'does not even approach' the level required for the jury to be sure he was the killer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For the third route she referred to evidence about the 'sightings' of Rikki and said of the defence witnesses: 'If any one of those sightings might be correct then James Watson must be not guilty.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Former PC Robert McNeill earlier told jurors he searched the woods just after 7:30pm on the evening of November 28.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He claimed Rikki's body was 'absolutely not' on the path where he was ultimately found.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Dempster said: 'If that is right... the prosecution case is upended and James Watson must be acquitted. You must be sure James Watson killed Rikki Neave.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But she added: 'If you think James Watson was in the woods with Rikki Neave then you will go ahead and convict but we submit that the evidence doesn't begin to reach that level.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We now know did a sort of deal with the prosecution. The prosecution now say we made a terrible mistake, we should never have charged her (with murder).'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Dempster suggested she admitted child cruelty to spare jurors of the 'full horror' of her treatment of her children and maximise her chances of being acquitted of murder.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Given her acquittal it turned out to be a very highly effective strategy.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Dempster said the CPS has had 'literally years' to assess the evidence but 'despite our trial involving dozens of witnesses we are actually no further forward in establishing what happened to Rikki on November 28, 1994.</p><img id=i-a0f046ffeac3450f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/06/09/56057433-10672985-The_prosecution_heard_that_Watson_murdered_Rikki_in_the_woods_be-a-14_1649232309374.jpg height=933 width=962 alt="The prosecution heard that Watson murdered Rikki in the woods before midday on November 28 before returning to Woodgates Children¿s Home that afternoon.
