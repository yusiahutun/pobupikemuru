For Kyle Sumnicht of Jensen Beach, this is exactly the predicament he found himself in when his appetite for blue water big game replaced his earlier interest in fishing the backwaters around Stuart. Sumnicht was venturing farther and farther offshore on his 21-foot bay boat, and after one too many rough rides back to the inlet, he decided a trade-up was in order.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/05/A-live-well-at-the-helm-station.-Photo-by-George-LaBonte-1024x730.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s2>His criteria for a suitable replacement included a ruggedly </span>built boat designed to handle the unpredictable weather changes all too common in our area. A good sea boat with enough freeboard to keep the water outside the boat was the first box to check. A no-frills center console without any clut<span class=s2>ter that’s easy to fish around and cleans up easily was also key. His basic equipment needs were simple: a fish box to keep his catch fresh, a live well to keep plenty of bait alive, a large shade top for sun protection, electronics capable of precise navigation, and a depth sounder for locating structure and fish.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/05/Aerial-shot-of-the-Dusky-252.-Photo-by-George-LaBonte-1024x731.jpg><p class=p3>When Sumnicht began his search, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Dusky</a> brand was top of mind. It was Dusky Sport Center, after all, that had sold his father a 15-foot aluminum Sea Squirt many years ago. Sumnicht had always admired the larger Dusky models that the Brown family has been building for more than half a century, and they fit the mold for what he was now in search of to the very last detail.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/05/Sumnicht-at-the-helm-which-is-equipped-with-Simrad-electronics.-Photo-by-George-LaBonte-1024x683.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s2>Sumnicht originally intended</span> to purchase a 22-foot model, but his first visit to the factory led him into a deal he just couldn’t pass up on a brand-new 252 Open Fisherman that was ready for delivery and priced within his budget.
