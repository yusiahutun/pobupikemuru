With the business facing imminent failure, Louis patented a manual clothes washer that Emory crafted a motor to work automatically.</p><p class=align-left>Sears, Roebuck and Co. later joined them in 1916, and that skyrocketed their sales. That was the start of a journey that has promoted their legacy a century later. After a decade, in 1929, Whirlpool merged with Nineteen Hundred Washer Company, and they changed their name to Nineteen Hundred Corporation. Interestingly, Whirlpool manufactured weapons parts and related products during the Second World War. In 1940, the company pioneered a new technology; an automatic spinner they nicknamed “Jeep.”</p><p class=align-left>In the 1950s to 60s, Whirlpool massively <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">diversified</a> as it engaged in laundry equipment, refrigerators, air conditioners, cooking-range products and many more. The company later acquired other firms in its global expansion drive. Currently, the firm has Whirlpool, Brastemp, Indesit, Maytag, KitchenAid, Jenn-Air, Amana, Bauknecht, Brastemp, and Consul under its list of conglomerates.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0e237afd5ad09bb6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>OG's Rides: Khaligraph Jones' Impressive Car Collection Worth Over KSh 15 Million</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Whirlpool has been a great supporter of energy and water efficiency since the 1970s.
