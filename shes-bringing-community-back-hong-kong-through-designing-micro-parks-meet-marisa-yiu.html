Reminded of this, she gives a good-humoured eye roll. These days, she agrees, she has slightly dialled down the academic jargon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/30/9d5d2a46-45fe-4306-840b-5913535402d8_db8031ac.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m trying to simplify my delivery …” Did anyone suggest that? “No!

(“It’s not like I worked for it.”) She’s coy about her age, but that was during the British-colonial era and it’s easy to imagine her – tall and striking – as one of those admirably capable schoolgirls from the pages of Enid Blyton.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She was also a competitive tennis player. She began at eight and, as a junior, played for Hong Kong, travelling around Asian tournaments. “I play it back in my mind and think, ‘Oh my God, maybe that informed my love for cross-cultural projects.’”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Was she good about defeat? “Not really. But we learned to pick ourselves up fast. Tennis is beautiful. It’s courteous. You lose but you still shake hands. The resilience is good training.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong urban walks reveal sides of the city you’ve never seen before</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By her mid-teens, she’d burned out. “I was missing a social life and school, I knew I wanted to focus on lessons.” Unlike most of her classmates, who took the British university route, she applied to do a liberal arts degree at Columbia in New York.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She’d chosen the US because she loved the arts and fashion and could defer selecting her major for two years.

Her thesis, for example, explored the global assembly lines of the garment industry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was all about how communities are shaped. My parents had friends with factories in China, and I was researching and mapping factories – about 500 – in New York’s Chinatown. After 9/11, whole neighbourhoods shut down; it really made me feel how fragile communities are.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That same year – 2001 – she met Eric Schuldenfrei, then a visiting architecture lecturer at Princeton and now head of the Department of Architecture at the University of Hong Kong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/30/857e1dc5-952e-4a59-924e-9f8650597f56_0ee77f19.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yiu worked for four years at the New York architecture firm Kohn Pedersen Fox until 2005, when she and Schuldenfrei combined their names and talent to set up an architectural practice called ESKYIU, deliberately pronounced “askew” to emphasise an unexpected approach.</p>One of their first projects, in 2006, was Chinatown WORK, a New York art installation about the disappearing garment industry. They moved to Hong Kong in 2007, and their subsequent work here – creating client spaces at <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Art Basel</span></a>, for example, or at (the now closed) Spring Workshop in Wong Chuk Hang – has tended to skew to the artistic and the academic.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Yiu became Hong Kong’s chief curator for the 2009 Shenzhen and Hong Kong Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism and Architecture, Schuldenfrei was curator for education, film and media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/30/0b5002a1-9053-4529-846b-3e7f4e56b3be_b07091a3.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He was pivoting all his focus on academia,” she explains of her husband (they married in 2009 and have twin boys). “And I felt that urgency to knit back a sense of community again through our fellowship programmes, our parks projects.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Essentially, at DTFS, she’s a fundraiser: she asks for money to support other designers, architects and scholars. She hums a little, a tic she has when she’s processing what sounds like a less-than-perfect situation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I didn’t study this,” she agrees. “But I feel there’s a lot of potential generosity and resources.

What I really appreciate is this project shows such a positive side of humanity.”</p>Pushed a little, she talks about <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the Shek Tong Tsui micro-park</span></a>, less than a minute’s walk from her office. At night, it is lit by an installation that loops, like the track of a firefly, under the massive Hill Road flyover.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There was a lot of diplomacy and smiling. Maybe 10 years later we’ll reveal everything,” she says. She’s hesitating. She knows she’s askew, that she’s veering off-message.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We couldn’t accept the steel frame, it was not what was designed. After many meetings we all agreed, and it was dismantled. We had to show [the installation] is not art, it’s not sculpture – it had function. We had to go to endless meetings to fight for those values.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/30/1edd79f0-2d4e-490b-ac7c-1017bc194588_b07091a3.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She had many of what she calls her overthinking “brain explosions”: should she write a “sweet letter” or should she “throw a fuss”? That early training of discipline and determination prevailed. New engineers were brought in.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What’s remarkable is – it’s built! Doing this is maddening and fun … but it does keep me up at night.” And she beams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOnZysoZejeqq6056poqeiqHyivtOimqWdX2h%2FdX%2BSb2xoq5iawG6u0aKloKGenHqku8ymrKehpK56o63CpGShp56ceqy7zaBkraCipMKotIydnKyhl6O2r7OMpqCcqp9ivaK%2Byqxkpp2VqXqurdGiqpplqZ7C</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
