The mother-of-three's bobbed hair was worn in loose waves which appeared to have been combed through for a natural look. Her skin was lit from within and she added a simple lip oil to allow her mauve smokey eye to do the talking. For jewellery, Zara popped a fine gold chain around her neck and a pair of pearl-adorned gold hoop earrings. Her husband Mike, 45, also opted for a smart-casual look pairing dark-wash jeans with white trainers, a white open-neck shirt, and a done-up double-breasted navy blazer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dde61087da4b-zara-tindall-makeup.jpg><p id=eNKn9Czph9 data-wc=99>The red carpet appearance soon after Zara and Mike's return from their equestrian-orientated trip to Australia.

In an <a class=hm-link href=#>exclusive interview with HELLO!&nbsp;</a>Zara said that her annual trip to Queensland has made Australia feel like a "second home". She added: "Mike and I both love the vibe and personality of Australia," Zara says. "It really suits us with the outdoor lifestyle and everything that comes with it. What is not to love about being here? It feels busy but being by the beach and in the middle of summer is also relaxing, especially coming from the depths of our winter right now back home."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ede57bc40df1-zara-tindall-and-mike-wimbledon.jpg><p id=e5BkadoNRn data-wc=14><strong>DISCOVER: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Mike Tindall channels wife Zara Tindall in hilarious photo from lavish Australia trip</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=eY3QWUugAc data-wc=91>Zara, the Olympic eventing rider, even got to take part in the Pacific Fair Magic Millions polo and showjumping.
