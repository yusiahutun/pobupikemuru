The episodes will follow the last few months of Princess Diana’s life, where the royal spent much of the summer travelling around the Mediterranean with her partner Dodi Fayed, and her two sons, Harry and William. For this reason, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/style-files/g33248219/princess-diana-fashion-style/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="her wardrobe" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">her wardrobe</a> makes a real departure from what we have seen through seasons four and five, which was mostly filled with ballgowns and smart suiting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There were lots of swimsuits on Diana this year,” says one of The Crown’s costume designers, Sidonie Roberts. “She’s wearing them for four episodes – in fact, the majority of her outfits on her rail for this season were swimsuits.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The most iconic of these is the blue swimsuit that Diana was photographed wearing as she is perched on the end of a diving board on Fayed’s yacht. This was actress Elizabeth Debicki’s favourite Diana costume from the season and was one that the costume designers really felt the pressure to get right.</p><img alt="the crown" title="the crown" width=5760 height=4320 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-crown-diana-season-6-3-6554aaa183307.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I really love the blue swimsuit that Diana wears when she walks out to the end of the diving board and sits down,” Debicki said. “There was just something about that swimsuit and recreating that moment that felt very sacred and important, and it was very important we got it right.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“In a way, it reminded me a little bit of when we shot the revenge dress,” she adds, referencing one of the most iconic outfit recreations for season five. “It's as close as possible to the real imagery and yet what I get to do as an actress, kind of enter into that space, which all the things around it feel so accurate, and then I get to discover what's emotionally in that moment. And, just like the revenge dress as well, I didn't really know until I stepped out of the car. At this moment I didn't really know until I was sat there with the sea under me.”</p><img alt="the crown" title="the crown" width=5760 height=4320 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-crown-diana-season-6-1-6554aaa189f7b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That swimsuit – as with all the others Debicki wears in the series – were created by Gottex, the same brand that Diana wore, which were made specifically for the actress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“That blue swimsuit is so iconic,” Roberts says. “That image of her, what we call ‘walking the plank’ and sitting at the end there, it's so iconic that I think for an actor when they're in that, it makes them feel completely in their character.”</p><img alt="the crown" title="the crown" width=2560 height=1920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-crown-diana-season-6-4-6554aaa142382.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Other favourite outfits of the costume directors from the season were also quite low-key looks, and some which were not based on anything specific Diana had ever worn.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Diana's costume from this year that I love is when she's saying goodbye to Dodi,” costume designer Amy Roberts said. “It's the first trip that she takes, it's with the whole Fayed family. She's walking back to get her tender with William and Harry, and she's saying goodbye to Dodi. She wears striped trousers and a Guy Laroche top that almost looked like a suit but they were bought separately. And I love it. And the reason I love it is because it is so Diana, even though we've never seen her wear something like that.”</p><img alt="the crown" title="the crown" width=5760 height=4320 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-crown-diana-season-6-2-6554aaa1918de.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When we can hit that mark, I really enjoy it because you totally believe there's a photograph of her, you totally believe it's her, even though there's no reference image of her wearing something exactly the same as that. It comes back to what I call the Diana algorithm…it’s not something from a reference image, it's not something we've seen, but it just is something that she would wear.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Sidonie, her favourite outfit was from another another private moment, where they could imagine what Diana might have be wearing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“One of the favourite scenes of mine is where she's reading the newspaper and she's in Mohamed's villa,” she says. “It's press of Camilla's 50th birthday and she's just in, it's so long, it's like a dress, huge Adidas T-shirt. So just the kind of contrast between that, this like 50th part of Camilla and then she's just lounging about. It's those nuances, it's those moments where you get to be clever or unexpected.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first instalment of season six of 'The Crown' will debut on Thursday 16 November on Netflix.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG1scWxlbX50e9OhnGaboqTEr3nDopinmV2YvLTA1KacrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
