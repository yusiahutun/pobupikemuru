"Danny Fells, the New York Giants tight end, and Julie Benz from 'Dexter' is one of our regulars, and I'm sure you've read about a lot of the others. Including, of course, The Material Girl, which, everyone knows."</p><p>While it may seem like Nichelle has trained many Hollywood heavyweights, there is still one duo she is dying to get her hands on!</p><p>"Jay Z and Beyonce no questions asked! Hands down, those are my two," she gushed. "I've certainly been like, 'Wow, this person's here, that person's there,' but with those two… I usually play a Jay Z song every class. I just love what he stands for and where he came from. I use him as an example to everyone."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f0/o/2015/07/24/f0d308f3032a56a1b097cc85ebc216a8_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The trainer just added a new client to add to her list: <strong>Khloe </strong><strong>Kardashian.</strong></p><p>The "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" star took a class earlier this month with her rumored new flame <strong>James </strong><strong>Harden</strong>. So how did the reality star do?</p><p>"James is a very good friend of mine. As far as he and Khloe, they did fantastic," she raved. "We all know Khloe gets after it, right? I mean we've seen pictures of her working out. And I love that about her. We loved having them and they'll probably be here again. Not to say when, but…everybody wants to know when."</p><p>And if you're one of the many who is dying to see a celeb at the next Cycle House class, Nichelle gave us an exclusive star spotting tip.</p><p>"Check for those pop-ups. If you're looking at the schedule and all of a sudden there's a class that wasn't on the schedule before and all of a sudden it's there, there's a pretty good chance it's for someone special, especially if my name's on it as the teacher. There's a little secret hint."</p><p>What do you think of the latest celebrity fitness craze?
