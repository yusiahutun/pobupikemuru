That role helped him rise to fame and secure his next big gigs in No Way Out, Bull Durham and Field of Dreams. But no matter what roles he took on, fans will always love his portrayal of Frank Farmer in The Bodyguard.</p><p>The actor revealed why people can’t get enough of the iconic 1992 film during a previous interview with <a href=#>ABC News Radio</a>.&nbsp;“We want that level of security — who cares for us, who loves us, who would stand in front of us, who would stand for us, but the reality is, we have this little songbird, <a href=#>Whitney [Houston</a>], who had this big voice that came out of her and it was her first movie,” he said of his former costar.&nbsp;“She was so beautiful and I thought, ‘Well, this is the girl for me.'”</p><p>Kevin used that money he earned from The Bodyguard and other films to take care of his family. The actor is a <a href=#>proud dad of seven kids.</a> He shares kids Annie, Lily and Joe with first wife,<strong> <a href=#>Cindy Costner</a>. </strong>He also has a son named Liam from a previous relationship with ex-girlfriend <strong>Bridget Rooney. </strong>Kevin is also a dad to kids Cayden, Hayes and Grace, whom he shares with&nbsp;&nbsp;his current wife, <strong><a href=#>Christine Baumgartner</a></strong><strong>.</strong> With a large family, Kevin has to keep working to support his brood. That’s one of the reasons why he took on the role of John Dutton in Yellowstone and Enzo in The Art of Racing in the Rain.</p><p>“As a provider, I have to go to work. My great joy is them,” the <a href=#>wealthy star</a> previously told <a href=#>Zoomer</a> about his family, before letting out a laugh.&nbsp;“My [youngest] daughter wants to do ballet, but she’s more interested in buying all the dresses. She’s 4, and I say, ‘You have to dance, too,’ but she’s more in love with the dresses and she has, like, six dresses now. So I’m like, ‘When is she going to start dancing?’ So I have the confusion every man has with his daughters, all of them.”</p><p>Looks like Kevin won’t be slowing down anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Scroll below to see pictures of Kevin through the years!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46knK%2BhnmKwsL%2FTp5yrq12pv6K60p%2Bmq6WRqbawuoypn6isn6h6sLKMrZ%2BeZZGYwbC%2BjKitnqpdqbWmediemKurXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
