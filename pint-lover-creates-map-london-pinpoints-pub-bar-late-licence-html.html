It's good, but it's not quite right. Almost all of these places are only open late on Thurs - Sat.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'All in all, the late-night assessment of London is: not as bad as people complain about, but could do better.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Please do let me know what I've missed. Together we can make sure we're never further than 20 minutes away from a place to get a pint after 2am.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Does James have any favourites?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He told MailOnline Travel: 'Probably PJ O'Connor's in Wood Green, and the Hornsey Arms in Hornsey. They're the ones that started it all - proper pubs that are open late. I then had to expand it to include bars as well, as there are just not that many pubs open beyond about 1am.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>James added that 'possibly my favourite thing about doing this was finding out the wildly optimistic opening hours of Sean Og's in Harrow' - it's open 24 hours.</p><img id=i-2f88658f23280808 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/26/12/70252177-12015809-image-a-26_1682508979542.jpg height=404 width=634 alt="James 'thinks', he's logged 181 pubs and bars, telling MailOnline Travel that he's 'constantly adding and taking away based on people's feedback'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>James 'thinks', he's logged 181 pubs and bars, telling MailOnline Travel that he's 'constantly adding and taking away based on people's feedback'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His creation has received plenty of praise.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Twitter user Jack Pitt-Brooke commented: 'Jimmy, you are truly doing the lord's work.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And 'The Lingerista' said 'thank you for your service'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>Jimmy can be found on Twitter at </span><a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#><span class=mol-style-italic>@jimmymacmusic</span></a><span class=mol-style-italic> and on Instagram </span><a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#><span class=mol-style-italic>here</span></a><span class=mol-style-italic>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6aqa2hk6Gybn2RaWhucGBufJG1za1kpaemmr9ur9GemK2do2K6oryMhaannJ%2BjerG1zammoqakqHqxwcFmmZqqXaGutbGMpaCcnZ6Ysm%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
