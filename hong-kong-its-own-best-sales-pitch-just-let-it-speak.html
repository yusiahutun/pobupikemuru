A former politician will make a dramatic claim to have escaped from Hong Kong to avoid persecution, a former bigwig will lend support and the administration concerned will arrange a photo op with a senior figure to give everyone some free publicity. Everybody wins.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is even better if the Hong Kong authorities give in to the urge to issue an intemperate response, then the whole merry-go-round can complete the circle again. How can we diminish the vicious narrative cycle about the city and tell the whole world about how things are here?</p>Perhaps Hong Kong should start by ceasing to add fuel to the fire. Whenever government officials <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">attack named individuals</span></a> in a high-profile way using strong language, the outcome will only add lustre to their standing. Publicity-seeking politicians in other countries will be lining up to have photographs taken with them. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/12/15/clean-thumb_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:42</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Hong Kong offers HK$1 million bounties on another 5 fugitive opposition figures</p><p>Hong Kong offers HK$1 million bounties on another 5 fugitive opposition figures</p>I was disappointed to hear the Secretary for Security Chris Tang Ping-keung and other government figures say that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">going after fugitives</span></a> is likely to be the top priority following the enactment of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Article 23 legislation</span></a>. Is this the best course of action? After all, the people involved will never come back and their host governments are highly unlikely to extradite them.Surely the city government’s first priority should be to rule wisely and ensure social stability is maintained. How about a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">statutory minimum size</span></a> of residential unit so that the creative young people the city wants to retain and attract have the prospect of a decent living space for themselves and their families? How about a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">decent minimum wage</span></a>?<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Article 23 bill’s passage means improving people’s lives starts now</span></p></a></h3>The message should be simple: Hong Kong is a great place to live and work. It is a safe city to visit, and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">travel advisories</span></a> by some governments to the contrary are off the mark. If people have any doubts, they can come and see for themselves.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We should not be drawn into clause-by-clause debates on the new national security legislation, just a brief statement to point out that what the government has done is also present in other common-law jurisdictions, and that China is as entitled as anyone else to protect the country’s security. Then we should stop talking. The fire will never go out if we continue to give it oxygen.</p>When should this public relations drive begin? One suggestion is to wait until all pending <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">high-profile trials</span></a> have been completed. I do not support this idea as the proceedings will run for many months yet, including appeals, and there may be new ones in future.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The city cannot afford to be held hostage to judicial processes which run relatively slowly if it is to continue to promise a fair trial. In the end, Hong Kong will be judged by what it does, not by what it says, so we must continue to do the right thing.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">As we mark Easter, Hong Kong would also welcome the hope of renewal</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Who will make the best envoys? I’m sorry to say I cannot think of a single minister who comes across as a natural diplomat. The best performances by locals that I have seen so far have been by the current and former conveners of the unofficial members of the Executive Council.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee stood up well to the customary tough questioning on the BBC’s Hardtalk, and Bernard Chan represented the city well in a CNN interview with Julia Chatterley. But they are both part of the establishment, so however well they perform there will always be an aura of scepticism around them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/12/15/clean-thumb_1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Looking back to American Chamber of Commerce chairman Jim Thompson stepping up in 2003 to help Hong Kong’s economy recover in the aftermath of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak could provide an answer. The city should trawl the international business community, particularly leaders of international chambers of commerce, to identify effective advocates.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong has many friends and supporters from the international community already based here, in some cases for many years. Who better to talk to Americans, Australians, Britons, Kiwis or Canadians than their compatriots?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But in the end it will take a combined effort from all Hongkongers. Everyone with friends or relatives overseas should be urging visits. Hong Kong is its own best sales pitch, it just needs a chance to speak.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Mike Rowse is an independent commentator</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvLG1zaKmp2eYpLuoecqopaBln6W2r7XOp2aaqqSesK2xjmxpbm9pboBwtM6nnmajn6O0brXTrGSor55ir6a%2F02aqmqSVqHqxtdOcn2aipajBbrjErWSirF2ovaatyg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
