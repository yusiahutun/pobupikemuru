Everlane says it "holds their factories to the highest standards, working with two third-party auditors to perform four audits a year both announced and unannounced to evaluate factors like fair wages, reasonable hours, and environment. The Everlane team visits each factory 2-3 times each year. If a factory falls below a 90 audit score, Everlane works with them to make improvements and if they don't, they simply stop working with them." However Everlane does not publish the results of these audits, and transparent costing includes a generic labor costing formula that is used across the industry, taking a country’s minimum wage as its base. It provides no explanation or assurances that this wage is actually getting paid. (Other companies in the industry, using the same factories, are working in this regard to get these assurances. Everlane is not a part of those multi-stakeholder initiatives.</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>How they define sustainability: "</strong>All Kowtow garments are certified by non-profit internationally recognized organizations.
