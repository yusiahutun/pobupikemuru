Eden Westbrook, 15, was found in Fisherman's Memorial Park in St Helens in the state's north-east, two hours from Launceston, at dawn in February 18, 2015. 
Despite police quickly arriving and awkwardly attempting to shield the scene from the view of the public, Ms Westbrook's body was seen by multiple people, including a bus full of schoolchildren, due to her position in a tree."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

who knew) the man who'd supposedly put Eden up the tree had passed this information on to the person I was talking to.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The visitor provided the names of a man and much younger woman, who are known in the town but have never been named by media.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He explained the man had allegedly confessed his involvement to his then girlfriend, who in turn told her mother who had told the visitor's friend.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Westbrooks' said the younger girl the visitor identified had been known to be acting increasingly bizarrely in the years since Eden died and had on occasions gone up to members of their family ranting that she was 'sorry'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Lavac spoke to a

Eden was a caring person who was doing well in Year 10 and was highly regarded by both her students and teachers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But she noted her school internet search history showed, perhaps not uncommonly for a teenager, searches on topics such as unprotected sex, depression and drugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She deemed Eden had been depressed, had previously attempted to harm herself, and had written a note six months earlier indicating an 'intent to end her life'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Westbrook strongly denies that this was the case saying 'at no stage did Eden try to take her own life'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite a large gap between the teenager leaving her parents house and arriving at the park remaining unaccounted for, the coroner said she was 'satisfied there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding Eden's death or that any other person was involved'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Westbrooks are pushing for a new open and transparent inquest to be held that would examine new information and interview new witnesses.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They hope this would not only
