Now, let us run you through a detailed buying guide.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Choose the Best Self-Tanner for Men?</h2></p><p>Here are a few aspects that you should consider before splurging on the best self-tanner for men:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Skin Type And Undertone</strong>: Ensure that you analyze your skin type and undertone before splurging on any of the best self-tanners for men. It is wise to invest in the one that not only helps you attain the perfect tan but also leaves your skin utterly nourished. If you have sensitive skin, then choose a tanner that is gentle and mild just like St.Tropez Self Tan Classic Bronzing Mousse. On the other hand, pay heed to your skin undertones to achieve a desirable shade.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Warm Undertone: For all those who possess a warm undertone, make sure you get your hands on a good-quality men's self-tanner that features a lighter and warmer shade.&nbsp;</li><li>Cool Undertone: For those who have cool undertone skin, pick the best men's self-tanner that is darker in shade.</li></ul><p>To accentuate the beauty of your existing skin tone, choose a tanning cream for men that matches your natural skin color. Likewise, to attain a deep and darker tan, pick a buildable tanning lotion for men that comes in an ultra-dark shade so that you can easily attain the color you desire.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Type of Self-tanner</strong>: There are 4 types of self-tanners available on the market. They differ according to their respective texture, formula, application method, and consistency. Here are some common types:</p><ul><li><strong>Mousse</strong>: Self-tanning mousse is a type of bronzed foam. It is widely used by those who possess dry skin.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Lotion</strong>: A self-tanning lotion is easily buildable and it works for all skin types.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Spray</strong>: A self-tanning spray is nothing but a dense mist that is widely used by professionals.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Drops</strong>: For temporary results and everyday usage, self-tanning drops work the best.</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Check the list of ingredients before getting your hands on the self-tanner for men. It is advisable to invest in those that are enriched with active ingredients as well as gentle ingredients like vitamin E, aloe vera, hyaluronic acid, cocoa seed extract, coconut, botanical extract, etc just like Glossiva Illuminating Self-tan Drops. Do not invest in tanners that contain synthetic ingredients or harsh chemicals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Coverage</strong>: Pay heed to the level of coverage offered by the tanner. Some of them will lend you a subtle tan whereas others might give a deeper color. This usually depends on the shade and type of tanner. So, always check the shade and level of coverage that it promises to offer.</p><p><strong>Formula</strong>: Next, let’s talk about the formula! The formula of the tanner is also of utmost importance.
