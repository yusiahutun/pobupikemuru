The duo looked radiant as they arrived at Lincoln Center in New York City for the 2023 American Ballet Theatre Fall Gala.</p><p>“It’s our first time on the carpet together,” Oliver told PEOPLE at the event, calling Oliver “my boyfriend” and gushing over their shared appreciation for the ballet. “We love it, it’s very beautiful. We just saw [George Balanchine’s] Jewels&nbsp;last month, it was my birthday present.”</p><p>She continued by saying that the two had met “through friends” and had been dating for “over a year.” Ubah said, “I want to say things like, ‘We met on Tinder or Bumble,’ but not really.”</p><p>For the occasion, Ubah looked stunning in a silver sequin one-shoulder gown with a thigh-high slit. She added dangling silver earrings and silver shoes to complete her ensemble. Oliver, who goes by “Mr. Connecticut” on the Bravo series, looked dapper in a white shirt and navy blue tux.</p><p>When her costar Sai De Silva questioned Ubah about why she wasn’t dating, she initially told him in episode 13 of the RHONY revival. Her husband David Craig had asked. When asked why she doesn’t want the other women to know about her relationship, Ubah went on, “It’s something very new and I don’t want anyone else’s energy. I just want to make decisions for myself, and Sai can keep a secret.”</p><p>The pair’s first public appearance happened just hours after Dachsel’s identity was made public by the Daily Mail, which also claimed that they were present at the invite-only “RHONY” Season 14 launch party in July. “They were together the whole night. It wasn’t like they were making out, but they never left each other’s side, they were very giggly and she seemed excited to be introducing him to people,” an eyewitness told DailyMail.</p><p>“She was clearly very happy. Obviously, it was a private party, but I felt like she was comfortable having him there,” the insider added further.</p><p>“I think I kept it a secret because I’m so tired because every time I meet someone, I want everyone to see,” she explained. “And if it doesn’t work, then I have to go back and tell everyone it doesn’t work. I’m so tired [of saying], ‘Oh, it doesn’t work anymore.'”</p><p>It was disclosed in the RHONY season 14 finale that Sai had informed Brynn Whitfield and Erin Lichy about Ubah’s off-screen relationship with “Mr. Connecticut.” At Ubah’s birthday celebration, Brynn revealed her secret, which led to a major altercation between the whole ensemble. Ubah abruptly left the celebration and declined to talk about her romantic history.</p><h3><strong>Oliver Dachsel Age</strong></h3><p>Oliver Dachsel reached age 42 in October 2023. 1981 is reportedly his birth year.</p><h3><strong>Oliver Dachsel Family</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, Oliver Dachsel’s family details are not available at this moment.
