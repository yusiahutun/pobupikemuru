In other words, you should spend the first part of your research process singling out PCs that pack the right <a href=#>CPU and GPU combo</a> for your particular needs. If you’re a gamer, you probably want <a href=#>the best CPU</a> and GPU combo that fits your budget, but if you don’t play games and don’t require <a href=#>a powerful GPU</a> for productivity purposes, you can get by with a CPU packing an <a href=#>integrated GPU</a>.</p><p>Next, you should focus on secondary components that, in some scenarios, can be more important for the overall performance than the CPU and GPU. For example, if you find a pre-built PC that packs the right CPU and GPU combo but features only 8GB of <a href=#>memory</a>, a zero airflow housing, or includes inadequate CPU cooling setup, you might end up with a machine performing worse than a PC with a slower CPU and GPU but with an adequate amount of memory and a capable cooling setup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Secondary components include the <a href=#>motherboard</a>, memory, <a href=#>storage</a>, case, case fans, CPU cooler, and the power supply unit (PSU). So, once you settle on the CPU and GPU, ensure the PC(s) you’re interested in isn’t seriously lacking in some other department. Just note that pre-built PCs are, in most cases, not the best possible all-around machines and that some compromises had to be made.</p><p>Pre-built PC buyers should also pay special attention to the cooling setup. Many pre-built PCs try to get away with including the cheapest cooler possible that, in many scenarios, can lead to noticeable performance drops during CPU-intensive workloads. You should also look for pre-builts with decent PSUs that have some power to spare so that you can upgrade the PC with a more powerful CPU or GPU in the future. And if your workflow includes lots of writes to the storage drive, get a pre-built PC featuring an SSD with DRAM cache since those are much better at writing operations than DRAM-less solid-state drives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regarding memory, many pre-built PC brands try to save money by using <a href=#>slow RAM</a> inside the build or including less than ideal amount of memory. For example, if you’re buying a high-end gaming or productivity PC, 16GB of slow—anything below 3000 MT/s—DDR4 memory is insufficient. In the case of a high-end gaming PC, 32GB of memory is optimal nowadays, with 64GB or more being the right choice for powerful productivity-focused machines. If you’re looking for a budget or a mid-range gaming PC, 16GB of memory is a must.</p><p>Memory working in <a href=#>dual-channel mode</a> is a must for gaming pre-builts with DDR4 RAM. DDR5 RAM <a href=#>works differently</a>, so a single RAM stick should provide almost the same amount of performance as two sticks working in dual channel. Also, make sure your memory works <a href=#>at its specified overclock speeds</a>—XMP for Intel CPUs, EXPO for AMD CPUs—and not just at default speeds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An inadequate CPU cooler can drop CPU performance considerably, and lots of gaming-focused pre-builts try to cram the cheapest possible CPU cooler that may be fine for gaming loads, but the moment you try doing something that pushes the CPU to its limits, it will choke and <a href=#>thermal throttle</a> because the cooler can’t keep up. In general, try looking for pre-builts that pack at least 240mm AIO CPU coolers because, while there are loads of quality budget air coolers out there, pre-built PCs usually come with the cheapest possible cooling solution, and those are usually not great for anything other than budget CPUs.</p><p>Concerning the motherboard, most brands don't share the specs of the motherboards they use in pre-built PCs or, like Dell, include proprietary motherboards designed to be serviceable for the CPU in question but not much else. You don’t have much in terms of choice here, so we recommend not focusing on the motherboard and just getting a pre-built that suffices in other aspects. In most cases, a quality pre-built PC comes with at least an adequate motherboard for the included CPU.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the chassis, most pre-builts come with either proprietary designs or affordable aftermarket housings. Some brands, such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Origin PC</a>, allow users to pick from a list of PC cases, but those usually cost extra. If you plan on upgrading the PC in the future, we recommend skipping pre-built PCs made by Dell, Alienware, HP, and any other pre-built PC that comes with a proprietary motherboard, case, or power supply. Since you won’t be able to replace the motherboard or the PSU, you won't be able to use the case as the basis for a new machine.</p><p>Our last piece of advice is to read user reviews, especially those focusing on overall performance and thermals. A good number of pre-built PCs feature low airflow cases combined with cheap cooling setups, resulting in excessively high thermals that limit CPU and sometimes even GPU performance. You should get a pre-built with decent thermals where the CPU isn’t choking due to an inadequate cooler coupled with a low airflow case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><td colspan=3 style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p><strong>How Did We Research</strong></p></td></tr><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Models Evaluated</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Hours Researched</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Reviews Analyzed</p></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>34</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>7</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>17</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>How-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Corsair Vengeance i7400</a> is the company’s high-end pre-built PC that's a great choice for users needing an all-around PC to use for gaming and work.</p><p>The components used in the Vengeance i7400 include lots of the company’s bestsellers, including the excellent 4000D Airflow case, four high-end 120mm RGB case fans, the fully modular RM1000X PSU, 64GB of Vengeance RGB Pro DDR5 memory, and one of the best 240mm AIOs around, the H100i RGB Elite. The 2TB <a href=#>solid-state drive</a> (SSD) is also Corsair’s MP600, which is nothing to write home about but still more than a decent choice for the main storage drive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You’ve also got Intel’s flagship CPU, the Core i9-13900K, paired with the current NVIDIA's flagship GPU, the RTX 4090. Finally, the Z690 motherboard used is the MSI Pro Z690-A Wi-Fi, one of the best budget Z690 motherboards that features <a href=#>Wi-Fi 6E</a> and a 2.5GBps Ethernet. The overall package is impressive for a pre-built PC, and while Corsair could’ve put a 360mm AIO, the included 240mm unit is more than enough for any gaming scenario, and it shouldn’t noticeably limit the 13900K during CPU-intensive workloads.</p><p>The Corsair Vengeance i7400 presents one of the best all-round pre-built PCs on the market. The CPU and GPU combo is perfect for any game or productivity task you might have in mind, 64GB of <a href=#>DDR5 memory</a> is great for intensive productivity workloads, and the use of regular aftermarket components along with one of the <a href=#>best PSUs</a> around means you will be able to upgrade the PC in the future or build an almost entirely new PC inside the 4000D Airflow chassis while keeping the RM1000X PSU as the cornerstone of the new build.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The listed price of $3950 presents decent value, considering that building a similar PC on your own would cost only a few hundred dollars less. If you’re a professional looking for a high-end workstation, we recommend checking out <a href=#>Falcon Northwest's pre-built PCs</a> since you can equip those with NVIDIA RTX professional GPUs. And if you need a workstation specifically made for your specific workflow that also comes with premium customer support, check out workstation offerings from <a href=#>Maingear</a> and <a href=#>Puget Systems</a>. They come at a premium, but the customer support and expert advice you’re getting are worth the extra cash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ibuypower-intel-13th-gen-extreme-gaming-pc-featured.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Corsair Vengeance i7400</h5><span>Best Pre-Built PC Overall</span><p class=display-card-description>If you're looking for a high-end pre-built PC for gaming and productivity, get the Corsair Vengeance i7400.

This tiny PC takes less space than a toaster and costs less than $200 while coming with fantastic specs for the price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You’ve got a 12th Gen Intel N100 CPU, which is a four-core SKU without <a href=#>hyper-threading</a> that’s more than enough for light usage that doesn’t include CPU-heavy tasks or high-end gaming, with the integrated GPU being speedy enough to run 4K videos and 2D pixel art games. The Mini S12 Pro also packs 16GB of memory, a 512GB SSD, <a href=#>Wi-Fi 6</a>, and Gigabit Ethernet, everything a regular user might need in a PC.</p><p>We like the inclusion of four USB-A 3.2 10Gbps ports, and while you don’t get a USB-C port, you can use a cheap USB-C to USB-A adapter to connect USB-C devices to the PC. You can even run a multi-monitor setup since the Beelink Mini S12 Pro has two <a href=#>HDMI</a> 2.0 ports. All this is packed inside a tiny, sleek-looking chassis you can tuck anywhere on your desk or even carry around, considering its compact dimensions. You can even hide the case behind your monitor since the selling package includes a <a href=#>VESA mount</a> bracket.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Upgrade options include adding a 2.5-inch HDD/SSD or another <a href=#>M.2</a> SSD, since the main board features an extra M.2 SSD slot. Not great, but considering this is a mini PC the size of two soda cans, we’ve no issues with limited upgradability. Another potential downside is single-channel memory, but since this isn’t a gaming PC or a high-end workstation, single-channel memory isn’t a major issue.</p><p>If you need something beefier, capable of running newer games, and with enough horsepower for CPU-intensive tasks, the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Beelink SER5</a> comes with the AMD Ryzen 5 5500U CPU that’s much more powerful than the Intel N100 and that packs a more capable iGPU, while costing $60 more than the Mini S12 Pro.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/skytech-shiva-gaming-pc-featured.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Beelink Mini S12 Pro</h5><span>Best Pre-Built Budget PC</span><p class=display-card-description>The Beelink Mini S12 Pro packs a lot for less than $200.

The best thing about this pre-built PC is that you can tweak it to your liking by replacing every component on the buying page.

The Intel Core i5-12400F is still one of the best budget gaming CPUs around, and while the NVIDIA RTX 4060 doesn’t offer tons of value, it’s still almost as fast as the RTX 3060 Ti, one of the best bang-for-buck GPUs from NVIDIA while also supporting <a href=#>DLSS 3.0 frame generation</a> tech found in more and more new titles, which should prolong this graphics card’s usability when it comes to AAA gaming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other components include a decent-looking air CPU cooler —not great but more than adequate for the 12400F— 16GB of dual-channel DDR4 memory working at 3200 MT/s, a 650W 80-Plus Gold PSU, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and a motherboard with Wi-Fi 5 support. The chassis isn’t an airflow champion, but this CPU and GPU combo isn’t a huge heat generator, so thermals should be in check. At least the case looks very nice and packs a ton of RGB.</p><p>This config should provide excellent gaming performance at 1080p. You should be able to max or almost max out the details in the latest AAA titles and get 60fps or higher performance, even with ray-tracing effects in some games. At 1440p, the Skytech Shiva should be able to run AAA games at 60fps or higher with medium to high details. eSports titles should run at triple-digit frame rates no matter the resolution, as long as you don’t max out the visual options.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The best thing about this pre-built gaming PC is the price and the overall gaming performance you’re getting for that price. Concerning negatives, the motherboard looks rather basic, but, fortunately, the Core i5-12400F is power efficient and doesn’t require a beast of a motherboard to fully spread its wings. We also believe Skytech should’ve opted for a bit more powerful PSU —let’s say a 750W unit— to allow users to upgrade to a more powerful CPU and GPU in the future. Other than that, the Skytech Shiva presents an excellent pre-built gaming PC deal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Skytech Shiva</h5><span>Best Pre-Built Budget Gaming PC</span><p class=display-card-description>The Core i5-12400F is one of the best budget gaming CPUs and the RTX 4060 is a pretty solid choice for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and you can find both in the Skytech Shiva gaming PC.

EKWB is one of the most known names in the <a href=#>liquid cooling</a> community thanks to their superb custom loop, <a href=#>water cooling kit</a>, and AIO designs, and by looking at the components used in the EK 150 Battle PC, we can say the company didn’t make any compromises regarding the quality of said components.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You’ve got the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU and NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti GPU, with the CPU being cooled by the high-end EK AIO Elite 360mm D-RGB liquid cooler that can tame any CPU on the market.

The chassis is perfect for any future upgrade, the 750W SFX PSU is one of the most powerful small form factor power supplies you can get, and the flagship 360mm AIO should be enough to cool down any future CPU you might replace the Ryzen 5 7600X with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The CPU and GPU combo should allow for a high refresh rate 1440p gaming with zero compromises.
