Newly appointed to lead the expansion beyond live festival events and into artist development and management is Alberta native <strong>Casadie Pederson</strong>, who has been named Director of Artist Management and Development.</p><p>“I am so thrilled to be joining this admired team at Republic Live,” says Pederson. “Collectively, everyone brings so much experience to the table, and we are so excited to see where this will take us.&nbsp;This is the opportunity of a lifetime, and I can’t thank the RL team enough for welcoming me to a team that is dedicated to playing a bigger role in helping artists.”</p><p>Exciting news is on the horizon for the music industry as award-winning country artist <strong>Tyler Joe Miller</strong>, known for topping charts, gears up to launch new music in March through an upcoming partnership, the details of which will be revealed soon. What makes this announcement even more significant is Miller becoming the inaugural signing to the recently established management division.</p><p>The forward-looking strategy involves a strong commitment to ongoing artist development and scouting for new talents. Simultaneously, there are plans to bolster the company’s infrastructure, positioning it to play a more substantial role in supporting artists as they build and advance their careers.</p><p>This revelation underscores Republic Live’s enduring dedication to discovering exceptional talent, both on the international and domestic fronts within the country music genre. The roots of this commitment trace back to the vision of Stan and Eva Dunford, founders of the festival in 2011. Republic Live’s journey not only involves investing in artists but also cultivating a community of fans.</p><p>“It’s been a passion of ours since the beginning to seek out artists who we believe have incredible talent and potential,” shares <strong>Stan Dunford, co-founder of Republic Live and Boots and Hearts.</strong> “It’s time we take our enthusiasm for the industry, artists, and fans and work to invest in the future of artists while partnering with the best-in-class. We look forward to growing RLive with like-minded, hardworking individuals who are looking for the next step or searching to find their place in the country music scene.”</p><p>RLive will focus on highlighting the artist development principles founded within the&nbsp;<strong>Boots and HeartsEmerging Artist Showcase</strong>, extending that sentiment to launch the careers of emerging artists while elevating top-notch talent to the next level. Canadian talent previously recognized as top finalists in the Emerging Artists program includes many award-winning and chart-topping artists such as <strong>Tim Hicks, Tenille Arts, Josh Ross, Robyn Ottolini, Owen Riegling, Jade Eagleson, James Barker Band, The Reklaws, Tebey</strong>, and more.</p><p>The national Canadian contest consistently sees over 400 applicants a year as Boots and Hearts plays host each summer, with finalists that have proudly gone on to win countless Canadian Country Music Awards, JUNO Awards, multiple award nominations, garner number one songs on country radio as well as Canadian gold and platinum certifications, international recognition, and so much more.</p><p>Republic Live encompasses an incredible team that will extend its talents to RLive Management in the areas of Marketing, Social Media, Communications, Digital Marketing/Advertising, Sponsorship, Merchandise, and more.</p><p>With offices in Toronto and Nashville, Republic Live’s newly formed RLive management division will be based in Nashville. Pederson will work alongside Republic Live’s CCMA Award-winning <strong>Brooke Dunford</strong>, who continues to elevate and focus on talent buying and strategic growth for the company. The Republic Live Canadian office is also joined by <strong>Hannah Buske</strong>, who will support Brooke in future festival bookings and adds both management and marketing experience to the holistic team. Marketing and Brand Strategy for both artist and festival endeavors will be led by <strong>Anne Stirk</strong>, while Creative Direction remains with <strong>Eva Dunford</strong>.</p><br><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJBoaWxnopq9tq7LoppmpJmrsm64wK6lnKCVqHqzuMivnGalkaOuqLHMnqWtZZSew6q%2FyKilaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
