Among the passengers on the horse-drawn carriage were four children, two of whom -- 7-year-old Wilma Miller and 11-year-old Irma Miller -- later died from their injuries. The horse also died in the crash.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4a649e6b-890f-4de3-ad9b-6b9b8e93c761 data-container-ref=toofab:article:49bd1698-4a21-481d-9460-18daffa46cf9 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/72/5by4/2024/03/03/72f90dce493d429fa88264e3a322f27c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">GoFundMe/Washington County Sheriff's Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Man Receives Maximum Sentence for Killing Woman Who Accidentally Drove Into His Driveway</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>According to the criminal complaint</strong></a> against Samantha, a witness said he first saw one woman after the crash before another woman -- "who looked similar" to the first -- "just sort of appeared" at the crime scene. He said he "saw the second lady give the first lady a hug and heard the first lady say that she didn't see them until it was too late."</p><p>When authorities arrived, it was Sarah who told deputies she hit the buggy. When asked for her ID, she said it was in a nearby black SUV -- and not the silver one involved in the crash. Sarah allegedly said the vehicle in the accident belonged to her sister, claiming she was driving it because hers was in the shop. The deputy noted the two women "looked extremely similar."</p><p>After speaking with Sarah in the squad car, the deputy kept his digital recorder running as he stepped away from the vehicle. Per court docs, Sarah was heard talking to her sister, not knowing their every word was being picked up. "During the recording, Sarah can be heard saying, 'I think one of the guys is onto me but I don't really care ... there's no way they would ever know the difference between the two of us so they can't tell," reads the complaint.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d7f45421-cad5-4d5d-8e6d-0b55d7635ee6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:49bd1698-4a21-481d-9460-18daffa46cf9 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/47/5by4/2024/03/01/4708b0b59e424c3aaeadcaf2c0207e48_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Kokomo Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Names Suspected Killer In TikTok Video Before Murder: 'If You Find My Dismembered Body ...'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The apparently damning messages continued to pile up as the investigation continued.</p><p>A manager at an Hy-Vee where both sisters worked said Samantha messaged him on the day of the crash saying "that she messed up and was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of the crash." The manager believed Sarah took the fall for her sister because "Samantha took care of Sarah's children while Sarah was in prison and now, she feels like she needs to help Samantha."</p><p>An HR manager for Hy-Vee also received a call from Samantha that day, in which she allegedly said, "I f--ked up. I just killed two Amish people; they were kids ... I just hit a f--king buggy and I killed two people ... I'm not sober ... I'm high on meth." The manager also provided text messages in which Samantha allegedly admitted to the crash.</p><p>Security footage also showed Samantha leaving work in a silver SUV shortly before the accident, with a cell phone linked to Samantha being the one used to call 911. During her call, she allegedly said, "I didn't see them coming up over the hill."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:26e7d2c6-116c-420d-8087-8865e0f5f243 data-container-ref=toofab:article:49bd1698-4a21-481d-9460-18daffa46cf9 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d0/5by4/2024/02/29/d00b4e9087dc42fcae4fc9edb6b27374_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC12 News</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Cereal Killer' Who Murdered Wife After She Gave Birth By Putting Heroin in Her Food Loses Appeal</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>A search warrant was obtained for Samantha's home, but when authorities arrived at the residence, Sarah said her sister wasn't there. She also said she first called Samantha after the crash and had her sister call 911, in an apparent attempt to explain her twin's call. When authorities entered the home, they found Samantha inside the residence and gave her a blood test, which allegedly found a presence of meth, amphetamine and THC.</p><p>A social worker for Sarah's 13-year-old daughter also told authorities the girl claimed "my mom wasn't the one that was driving" -- while a text message from Samantha and someone only identified as "DH" allegedly showed her again admit to the crime.</p><p>After DH sent a message reading, "This little girl was killed today so sad," Samantha replied by saying, "I don't think you realize that I did that ... I hit that amish buggy and killed two ppl ... made Sarah come there and take the fall for it so I wouldn't go to prison."</p><p>Samantha's phone also had searches for, "What happens if you get in an accident with an Amish buggy and kill two people," "how to lock an iphone cops have" and "if you hit a buggy and kill two people are you going to prison?"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:608618d3-1475-494e-9f9b-9d5bdf38eceb data-container-ref=toofab:article:49bd1698-4a21-481d-9460-18daffa46cf9 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/97/5by4/2024/02/28/97db824bd17d4b45a1facfdf2b9d2e23_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">New Details Emerge In Murders of TV Host & Boyfriend as Tributes Pour In for Slain Couple</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While neither sister has been arrested, they have been hit with a ton of charges.</p><p>Among the 21 counts Samantha's facing include vehicular homicide under the influence and fleeing the scene, while Sarah has been hit with 16 charges -- including falsely taking responsibility for a crime and aiding and abetting.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/amish-buggy-accident-twins-charged-minnesota-15c8d8a6><strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong></a>, the father of the two girls who died said the women "were thinking about themselves" in the aftermath of the crash.
