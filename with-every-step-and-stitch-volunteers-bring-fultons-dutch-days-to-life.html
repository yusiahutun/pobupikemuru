Every week, they partner up and practice their steps to prepare for the live show.&nbsp;</p><p>Ella Holmbo has been dancing with her friend Kadence Kreider for seven years now.</p><p>“It’s fun because then you’re unique and you’re different and you’re not the same as everybody else playing travel softball and soccer or something like that,” she said.</p><p>Holmbo says this might be her last year dancing before she switches over to teaching.</p><p>Suzanne VerHoeven was one of just two adults at this dance lesson, and says she became immersed in the culture when she moved to Fulton several years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>“I borrow a costume and I think it’s really beautiful and I love to put it on,” she said.</p><p>While Huzienga helps the dancers learn their steps, Trudy Feldt is off to the side fitting kids for their handmade costumes.&nbsp;</p><p>Feldt has been making Dutch costumes since 1997.</p><p>“We take pride in the costumes and the fact that it’s a Dutch heritage affair,” she said.</p><p>Her living room is covered in fabrics of every shape, size and color. These days, she knows most of the designs from memory or old sketches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“They say ‘Oh you’re the costume lady! You’re the Dutch dancing lady!’ or something,” said Feldt.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, Feldt has made costumes for dozens of kids, piecing them together with whatever she can find.&nbsp;</p><p>“This is an upside down woven basket,” she said as she flipped one of the hats upside down.&nbsp;</p><p>Across town Kathy Bielema is also busy making elaborate costumes including her own for this year’s festival.&nbsp;</p><p>“I would say I probably average about four&nbsp;a year,” she said.&nbsp;“So that’s quite a few over 45 years!”</p><p>They’re made of everything from old purses to scraps found at second-hand stores.&nbsp;</p><p>“Putting it together can get tedious but the creative part, the search for the materials is what’s so much fun,” said Bielema.</p><p>And with determination and a lot of heart, these volunteers bring this small town’s story to the stage.</p><p>Don’t forget to join Local 4 News during our live broadcast at Dutch Days this Friday, May 3.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46woK2gXZrDpr7YZqqtnaBirq%2BwjKyroqyTnXq3u8uupa2dlafAbq7RoqWgZZaqubW7zaxkna2kmLVusMCyqmasn2K5qrLEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
