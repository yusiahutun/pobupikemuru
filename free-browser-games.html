When you see the word at the top, click connected letters on the board to create it. You can connect letters up, down, or diagonally to make the word.</p><p>Woggle starts off simple enough with words of just three letters. However, as you do well, you will progress to longer words which creates more of a challenge. You have limited time to find a certain number of words on a given list. When you find the word, click the last letter twice to submit it and move onto the next.</p><p>For more like this, take a look at these other <a href=#>free online word games</a> to play when you're bored.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shell-challenge>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shell Challenge</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ShellChallenge-MindGames.png><p>If you're looking for a test of your coordination and speed, try your hand at Shell Challenge. The rules are simple. You'll see a shell at the top of the screen. When the cards on the board reveal their items, click the identical shell as fast as you can.</p><p>What makes this online game a challenge is that the cards only reveal for a few seconds. After they cover and reveal again, the items change place. So, you must scan and click quickly. Once you reach the level goal you can move on.</p><h2 id=crash-it>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crash It</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CrashIt-Match3Games.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Collect jewels by making matches in Crash It. Unlike other matching games with gems, this one places the gems on the board in random spots for you to drop to the bottom. In order to drop them, match groups of three or more blocks of the same color.</p><p>You will see the number of gems you need of each color on the left. Since you have limited time, you may need to match blocks that drop an hourglass to the bottom to give you more time on the clock. Enjoy the soft music as you plan your moves in Crash It.</p><h2 id=number-mahjong>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Number Mahjong</a></h2><p>Mahjong games come in all shapes and sizes. If you love the genre, you should take a peek at Number Mahjong. Click matching numbers to create pairs and remove them from the board. And don't worry, there's no math involved here. Just match a 10 with a 10, a 17 with a 17, and so on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you clear the board, you'll move onto the next level and puzzle layout. Thus, you will never get bored with the same board. You can use hints and shuffles if you get stuck. Plus, the game offers relaxing music while you play.</p><h2 id=zoo-animals>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoo Animals</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ZooAnimals-MindGames.png><p>For a different kind of matching game, head to the zoo. Zoo Animals is a stacking game. Each stackable piece has part of an animal on it that you must match to its counterpart. The match will remove the animal from the board.</p><p>You can move one piece at a time or an entire stack. Just keep in mind that every so often, a new piece will fall from the top. Remove as many animals as you can to score and move onto the next level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Free Browser Games Sites to Play Multiplayer or Classic Games Online</a></span></p><h2 id=mystery-paradise>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mystery Paradise</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MysteryParadise-MindGames.png><p>In Mystery Paradise, your objective is to remove the colored background tiles by arranging the balls. Match three or more of the same colored balls to remove them and the background tile(s) from the board.</p><p>If you make a match, you continue with the balls already on the board. But if you make a move that does not make a match, more balls will appear. This is important to remember because in order to make matches, balls must have a direct path to each other. Clear the tiles and move onto the next challenging level in Mystery Paradise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cube-crash>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cube Crash</a></h2><p>Cube Crash is a match-three game with a fun twist. Yes, you need to click on three or more matching colors to remove the tiles from the board. But the trick is that in order to meet the level goal you have to plan ahead of time. If not, you may be left with less than three tiles of the same color to match---and fail.</p><p>As you move your mouse over the blocks of tiles, you will see how many points that click will get you towards your goal. So, listen to the jazzy music and strategize your matches as you work to complete each level.</p><h2 id=snail-bob>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snail Bob</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SnailBobSmall-GamesGames.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you like puzzlers with gadgets, levers, and buttons, then Snail Bob is one to check out. Your snail keeps on walking -- slowly of course -- but you can stop him with a click. Your objective is to get Bob to the exit by using the gizmos around him.</p><p>Rotate the levers to move objects, push the buttons to trigger ball drops, and figure out how to send Bob the snail to his safe spot in the pipe.</p><h2 id=cut-the-rope-magic>9. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cut the Rope: Magic</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CutTheRopMagic-GamesGames.png><p>If you enjoy casual games, then you've probably already played Cut the Rope.

Swap neon tiles of cocktails and goodies to match three or more. If you match four or more tiles, you can create special ones that blow away columns, rows, or blocks of tiles.</p><p>You have limited time to reach the level goal to move forward. So, keep your eye on the prize and your mind on the neon you see in Neon 3.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-and-jerry-mouse-maze>11. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom and Jerry Mouse Maze</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/TomAndJerryMouseMaze-GamePix.png><p>Based on the classic cartoon characters of Tom and Jerry, this cool maze game has you running for the cheese. In Tom and Jerry Mouse Maze, you must move Jerry around the room using your own mouse to get the cheese.

Collect your cheese and head to the mousehole to move onto another fun level.</p><h2 id=fox-adventurer>12. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Adventurer</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/FoxAdventurer-GamePix.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fox Adventurer is a puzzling game where you switch between day and night to find your way to the finish.

Each level in Fox Adventurer offers a unique and puzzling challenge.</p><p>For other titles like this, take a look at these <a href=#>puzzle games you can play for free in your browser</a>.</p><h2 id=monkey-bubbles>13. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monkey Bubbles</a></h2><p>If you like bubble shooters, then head to the jungle and play some Monkey Bubbles.

You have a limited number of moves to clear the board of fruit, so plan wisely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you aim carefully, you can bounce the bubbles off the walls to land them where you need them. You can also see which fruit bubble is next in your wagon and click to swap it with your current one. All monkeying around aside, this is a fun bubble shooter.</p><h2 id=letter-mix>14. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Letter Mix</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/LetterMix-GamesGames.png><p>For another out-of-the-ordinary word game, take a look at Letter Mix.

This game is all about the planning.</p><p>You have a limited number of baseballs to take out all of the clowns you see. So try to use ricochet action to clobber as many clowns with one ball as you can.
