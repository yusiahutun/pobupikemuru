I don’t want to show her here because she’s too gorgeous & I don’t want folks to feel bad about themselves in comparison,” the director, 56, replied to a fan via <a href=#>Twitter</a> on Sunday, May 7, after they asked about<a href=#> his and Davidson’s roles</a> in the film after seeing his name in the flick’s credits. “And my friend Pete not only voiced but actually came to visit us in Atlanta for a day and played Phlektik on set.”</p><p>Along with the response, Gunn shared a series of pictures from the movie set. In one picture, the filmmaker posed for a selfie with Davidson, 29, and <a href=#><strong>Chris Pratt</strong></a> as the actors donned their <a href=#>characters’ costumes</a>. The <a href=#>SNL</a> alum wore a dark ensemble with a turtleneck and had dirt smudged along his face. Pratt, 43, channeled his inner Starlord as he was decked out in a blue and red battle suit and smirked for the camera. The third photo was a still from the movie that showed Davidson in a mask as the alien guard.</p><p>Gunn returned to film the final installment of the Marvel franchise after he was<a href=#> temporarily removed from the project</a> amid backlash to inappropriate jokes the director tweeted a decade ago. The cast and fans of the film <a href=#>rallied behind the studio executive</a> and got him <a href=#>his job back</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/guardians-of-the-galaxy-janes-gunn.jpg><p>During the reprieve from Disney, Gunn went on to direct the 2021 DC studios film, <a href=#>The Suicide Squad</a>, which Davidson also worked on. The comedian portrayed a character named Blackguard.</p><p>Following the success of the film, Gunn was tapped alongside <strong>Peter Safran</strong> as the new co-chairmen and chief executive officers of <a href=#>DC Studios</a> in October 2022. As they signed on, a series of comic book adaptations were scrapped, including the <a href=#>Batgirl</a> movie and <a href=#><strong>Henry Cavill</strong></a>’s <a href=#>return as Superman</a>. Despite the criticism Gunn received for the rebranding, he took to Twitter to <a href=#>address the outcry</a>.</p><p>“One of the things Peter & I were aware of when we took the job as heads of DC Studios was a certain minority of people online that could be, well, uproarious & unkind, to say the least,” he penned in December 2022. “Our choices for the DCU are based upon what we believe is best for the story & best for the DC characters who have been around for nearly 85 years. Perhaps these choices are great, perhaps not, but they are made with sincere hearts & integrity & always with the story in mind. No one loves to be harassed or called names – but, to be frank, we’ve been through significantly worse.”</p><p>He also clarified that the decision to scrap Batgirl was made before he and Safran were in the picture.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy director is set to take the reins for the upcoming Superman: Legacy movie. On Saturday, May 6, during a Q&A with fans on <a href=#>Twitter</a>, Gunn teased that one actor from the Guardians franchise <a href=#>will have an appearance</a> in the upcoming DC flick.</p><p>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is in theaters now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeerJVisaLCyJ2qqKZdoq6ssdJmmGabkaKysHnIp2SgrZGnsaqtzaxkqJ5dqbWmecaao5qwqWLDsLiMbGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
