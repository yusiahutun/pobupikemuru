It was filled with To-Do lists, reminders, meetings and appointments—and then, suddenly, it wasn’t. As pandemic precautions forced me to stay home, I found myself attending fewer fashion events and swapping weekly dinners with friends to virtual Zoom happy hours instead. With barely any plans, my planner was all but useless. So, I decided to switch to <a href=#>a wellness journal</a>.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>In addition to meetings and appointments, I always made sure to write down one thing I was thankful for in my already-packed planner. Making <a href=#>time to practice gratitude</a> has always been important to me, so I made sure to write something every single day. Some days it was massive: a new job, a great date. Other times, it was smaller: a good hair day, a fun package in the mail. More often than not, it was less of a specific occurrence and more of a reminder of my year-round blessings: time with family, supportive friends, a career I’m passionate about.</p><p>Prior to March 2020, the gratitude section of my planner was squished down at the bottom of each day; then, when I stopped having plans and started spending 9-5 each day in <a href=#>the same desk chair</a>, it became the only thing I bothered to write down. Little by little, with nothing new going on, I found myself running out of things to feel grateful for—I knew I was blessed, but the slowing of my fast-paced life left me feeling defeated and depressed.</p><p><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

A major fan of <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Happy Planner</a>, I opted for the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Guided Wellness Journal</a>, a thick navy binder with Create What You Love written across the cover in rainbow lettering (This version is sadly sold out, but the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Guided Gratitude Journal</a> is still in stock, and can be used in the exact same way. Same for the <a href=# rel=nofollow>All The Feels</a> version). I worried I might find it too cheesy to use, but I left it beside my bed with a pen at the ready, and every night I forced myself to use it, until it became something I couldn’t imagine not reaching for.</p><p>In my wellness journal, there are prompts that I have the option to choose or ignore. Today I Can Honor My Body By…, One Thing That Inspired Me Today, What Brings Me Joy, What Would I Like To Stop Worrying About, What Makes Me Feel Loved. You get the gist.</p><p>Some days, I go down the page and answer every single prompt. Other days, I use the journal more like <a href=#>my old planner</a>, writing down everything I did for Future Me to look back on. On particularly emotional days, I write freely about my feelings. At the bottom of each page, there is a section to list the day’s Small Victories. This is where I expand on the things I’m grateful for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS-1-1.jpg><p>Another thing I really like about this journal is that it’s undated, so you can pencil in the dates as you go. In the past, missing days or weeks in a planner has <a href=#>triggered my anxiety</a>, but knowing I can take a day off if needed makes journaling feel like a welcome opportunity, not a stressful chore.</p><p>Some days, my journal is overflowing with thoughts, emotions, stressors or joyful moments. Other days, I write down a quick meeting, a fight with my sister, a walk through the neighborhood with my dog. Either way, writing things down keeps me grounded, and it <a href=#>makes me more positive</a>, too. On a particularly bad day, forcing myself to find one little thing to list as a Small Victory is enough to make me to go bed thinking life isn’t so bad after all.</p><p>2020 has been a hard year for everyone. I know I’ve felt it, and I’ve been luckier than most. If you’re looking for a way to strengthen your positive mindset, practice gratitude or get in touch with your emotions in 2021, I can’t recommend <a href=# rel=nofollow>a wellness journal</a> enough. What your entries lack in consistency, they’ll make up for in comfort.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcH2QcWhsbmlktaK8z7JkqaSRo7umvoywnKWknprAtHnJqKyrppGherOx1aKcsGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
