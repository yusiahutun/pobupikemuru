Since the invasion of Ukraine, of course, they have become even more reviled.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>How very different life was almost a century ago when the British newspaper magnate Sir William Pomeroy Burton, a former general manager of Daily Mail publisher Associated Newspapers, commissioned a French architect called Armand Albert Rateau to design him a Mediterranean villa.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The house, with traditional shutters and red-tiled roof, was completed in 1927. But Sir William soon found a villa he preferred at Cap Martin and within ten years Chateau de la Croe was on the market.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Its secluded location on the tip of Cap d’Antibes, a peninsula that stretches into the Mediterranean just east of Cannes, made it an attractive home for a high-profile couple looking for privacy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Its park-like grounds protected it from sightseers and no other house could be seen from its windows, which on one side faced the sea — so only those on yachts making their way between the resorts of Antibes and Juan-les-Pins could indulge their curiosity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A French socialite called Daisy Fellowes who had married into the British aristocracy, brought the house to the attention of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the former King Edward VIII and his new wife, divorcee Wallis Simpson, in 1938.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The couple, who had married in France a year earlier — of 300 guests invited, only 16 turned up — took an instant shine to the place and signed a two-year lease.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was certainly a home fit for a former king: apart from its 12 bedrooms, swimming pool, two bathing pavilions, and tennis court, La Croe had a dining room that seated 24, and a drawing room lined with tapestries and painted panels.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Its crowning glory was a bathroom featuring a 20-carat gold gilded bathtub shaped like a swan.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Duke of Windsor’s own furniture, silver and porcelain were shipped from England, and the Duchess recalled in her memoirs the ‘avalanche of crates, linen baskets, furniture, trunks of clothing, bales of draperies, chests of silver’ that covered the drive and lawns.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She and her interior designer Lady Mendl spared no expense in La Croe’s renovation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Soon, the chateau rivalled Buckingham Palace in splendour, with elaborate mirrors, gold and white mouldings and yellow, blue and white draperies filling the rooms.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Duchess spent months touring shops and auction rooms selecting antiques, accumulating a collection of paintings, ornaments, silken sheets and pillowcases which she had monogrammed with the couple’s initials.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Author Rebecca West was certainly impressed: ‘There are not many women who can pick up the keys to a rented house, raddled by long submission to temporary inmates, and make it look as if a family of good taste had been living there for two centuries.’</p><img id=i-89c8b35c5590bb5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/19/07/56774515-10729663-image-a-9_1650351571260.jpg height=862 width=634 alt="The Russian oligarch knew the house had a grand pedigree, with its former occupants including Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson, and he had the vision — and cash — to see how it could be returned to its former glory" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Russian oligarch knew the house had a grand pedigree, with its former occupants including Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson, and he had the vision — and cash — to see how it could be returned to its former glory</p><img id=i-71d511e3a963fa69 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/18/22/56560939-0-Constructed_in_1926_the_elegant_villa_comes_complete_with_over_a-a-9_1650317234164.jpg height=475 width=634 alt="Constructed in 1926, the elegant villa comes complete with over a dozen bedrooms, eight bathrooms and is set in 12 acres of lush woodland and lavish lawns just metres from the Mediterranean sea" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Constructed in 1926, the elegant villa comes complete with over a dozen bedrooms, eight bathrooms and is set in 12 acres of lush woodland and lavish lawns just metres from the Mediterranean sea</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Riviera’s idle rich came to pay court, grateful for the chance to mix with the royal couple.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Quite what the Duke’s French guests made of their host’s sometimes eccentric habits is anyone’s guess, however. In her memoirs, a bemused Duchess of Devonshire recalled one particularly memorable performance by the Duke.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He wore a kilt at dinner with all its extras, including laced-up pumps and a dirk [traditional dagger] in his stocking,’ she wrote. ‘A piper went round the dinner table playing his deafening music — more suited to the glens than the Cote d’Azur in the heat of July.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the outbreak of World War II, the Windsors’ suspected Nazi leanings meant they were ordered to leave Europe.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After seeing out the war in the Bahamas, where the Duke was given the title of governor, they returned to La Croe and, in 1948, threw a party to celebrate the 40th wedding anniversary of Winston and Clementine Churchill.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Given the former Prime Minister once issued a veiled threat to have the Duke court-martialled when he dragged his feet over agreeing to go to the Bahamas, this was a</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>generous gesture. But Churchill, who was between stints at Downing Street at the time, came away with mixed feelings.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Afterwards he wrote: ‘The Windsors are pathetic, but seem happy . . . the poor Duke, charming, now has to fight for his place in conversation.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For all the grandeur, however, a serpent lurked in the Windsors’ paradise: boredom. With no formal role to distract him, the Duke complained about the lack of golf courses in the south of France and, in 1949, the couple relocated to Paris, where they became the toast of high society.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But La Croe would retain its appeal for royals, becoming the home of a succession of monarchs — Leopold III of Belgium, Umberto, the ex-King of Italy, and King Farouk of Egypt.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1950, it was acquired by the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. He and his wife Athina Livanos lived there for seven years until she found him in bed with her friend, the socialite Jeanne Rhinelander.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>La Croe was then acquired by Onassis’s brother-in-law and business rival, Stavros Niarchos, who bought it — ironically — for his wife Eugenia Livanos, Athina’s sister</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the fire in the 1970s, La Croe was sold to an offshore holding company but came on the market again in 1998.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Given the scale of the renovation required, only an extremely wealthy individual would be prepared to take it on — step forward Roman Abramovich.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He spent an eye-watering £125 million on the installation of a gym and cinema in the basement, that rooftop pool and custom-made furniture and fittings. No expense was spared when it came to the grounds either.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Peter Wirtz, the son of noted Belgian landscape designer Jacques Wirtz, was brought in to lay out the gardens, which were planted with Californian and Mediterranean species.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the south of France spring has sprung and La Croe’s acres are coming into their own. But this is a vista denied to Abramovich, who frets in Moscow over the future of his fast-diminishing empire.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His old friend Putin appears to have no time for his high-profile attempts at peace-making and the West is growing ever more hawkish in its pursuit of his ill-gotten gains — but perhaps Abramovich can console himself with the thought that he has proved a worthy addition to the list of colourful owners who have enjoyed the Riviera’s most notorious chateau.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2BcYORcm1va192wG6ezqaYp2Vxl7%2Biuc6voJygXaG8pLfEnWSfmZKqubDB0maJoq6Zmr%2Biec%2Bio55ldISaipqofGSGgXR8mYaljKWmqKOjYr%2BwxcClZKmZo6l7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
