In this article, we’ll compare both of them—and give you a better idea of which one you should choose for your productivity-related needs.</p><h2 id=what-is-microsoft-to-do>What Is Microsoft To Do?</h2><p>Microsoft To Do is a tool developed by Microsoft to help users manage their day-to-day activities better. It’s relatively new, initially released in the spring of 2017.</p><p>Beyond keeping an eye on what you need to do each day, Microsoft To Do has numerous other capabilities. You can plan for weeks and months in the future, with various tools to help you do that. Microsoft To Do is available in many languages, including English, German, Swedish, and Korean.</p><h2 id=what-is-todoist>What Is Todoist?</h2><p>Todoist is a little older than Microsoft To Do, having initially launched in late 2012. The app works similarly to its Microsoft-created counterpart; you can gain a simple overview of the tasks you must complete each day when signing into the app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When <a href=#>using Todoist</a>, you can similarly plan longer into the future—as we’ll talk more about later. You can use the service in several languages, such as Spanish, Finnish, Japanese, and Portuguese.</p><h2 id=microsoft-to-do-vs-todoist-how-do-they-compare>Microsoft To Do vs. Todoist: How Do They Compare?</h2><p>With the basics of Microsoft To Do and Todoist covered, let’s look at how the two tools compare. In the subsections below, we’ll break down Todoist and Microsoft To Do in more detail.</p><h3 id=pricing>1. Pricing</h3><p>Todoist and Microsoft To Do differ quite a lot in pricing. You can use the app entirely for free if you choose Microsoft To Do for your daily task management. At the time of writing in January 2023, the service has no paid subscription plans; to use it, you simply need to create an account.</p><p>Todoist’s most basic plan is free, and many users will find this good enough for their needs. With the free version of Todoist, you can create up to 300 active tasks per project and have up to five active projects simultaneously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The free version of Todoist also lets you add as many as five collaborators for each project. You can’t set up reminders with the free version of Todoist, but you can with its paid subscriptions. Todoist’s paid plans are pretty affordable. Pro costs $48 per year or $5 per month if you’d rather pay monthly. Meanwhile, Business is $72 per year and $8 per month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/todoist-pricing.jpeg><h3 id=signing-up-for-an-account>2. Signing Up for an Account</h3><p>Before you use Todoist and Microsoft To Do, you’ll need to create an account with these services. However, the way you do this will differ depending on which one you choose.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you use Microsoft To Do, you’ll need a Microsoft account. Creating one is pretty simple; you can do so when you visit To Do’s sign-up page. If you already use Outlook, you can use this email address to sign in.</p><p>Todoist gives you a broader range of options to sign up for an account. You can log in with Google or Apple; if you use Facebook, you can also sign into Todoist with your profile.</p><h3 id=setting-up-recurring-tasks>3. Setting Up Recurring Tasks</h3><p>Some of our daily tasks will be one-offs, but others—such as reading emails and going to the gym—are more frequent. If you want to set up recurring to-dos, Todoist and Microsoft To Do let you do this.</p><p>When <a href=#>creating recurring tasks with Todoist</a>, the best way to do this is by typing the frequency into the title. For example, you can write “every Monday” to set up recurring tasks for that day. And if you have a particular date in mind, you can type that instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/todoist-recurring-tasks.jpeg><p>To set up recurring tasks with Microsoft To Do, select your task and hit the <strong>Repeat</strong> option. You’ll see a range of pre-selected options, and you can choose <strong>Customized</strong> if you want to pick something else.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/repeat-tasks-microsoft-to-do.jpeg><h3 id=planning-each-day>4. Planning Each Day</h3><p>In addition to setting up recurring tasks, it’s easy to plan each day in Microsoft To Do or Todoist. In both apps, you can type what you want to complete and make them a new addition to your checklist. When doing this, you don’t have to add a deadline if you don’t need to do that—though we will cover adding these in the next subsection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/todoist-overview.jpeg><p>Once you’ve completed a task on Microsoft To Do or Todoist, you can tick the item off your list by tapping on the circle. The process is identical on both platforms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/microsoft-to-do-overview.jpeg><h3 id=planning-for-the-longer-term>5. Planning for the Longer Term</h3><p>In addition to creating daily lists, Microsoft To Do and Todoist are excellent choices if you want to plan for the longer term.</p><p>With Todoist, you can type the name of the day or date that you want to add the task for. Once you’ve done that, select the <strong>Save</strong> button, and your changes will immediately appear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/deadline-in-todoist.jpeg><p>When using Microsoft To Do, you can create deadlines by going to a task and going to the <strong>Due</strong> tab. You can decide whether you want it to be due today, tomorrow, or next week. Alternatively, click on the <strong>Pick a Date</strong> button and choose when to complete the task.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/deadline-in-microsoft-to-do.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=compatibility-across-different-devices>6.
