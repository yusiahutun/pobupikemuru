Here's How You Could Fix It</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-05-07</div><p>There are times when you want to leave a comment on a YouTube video, but it won't post. Whether you get an error or it just doesn't appear, it can be pretty annoying if you can't leave your support for your favorite creator.</p><p>So, why exactly does this happen? And if that happens, what can you do to resolve it? Let's find out below.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=what-causes-youtube-comments-to-fail>What Causes YouTube Comments to Fail</h2><p>Sometimes, the reason you cannot post a comment is that you're inadvertently breaking some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Community Guidelines</a>. While you may think that your comment is innocent and unharmful, it might be violating some policies set by the video streaming site. So before acting on any of the suggestions below, ensure you're not posting the following.</p><h3 id=is-it-a-spam-comment>Is It a Spam Comment?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/spam-comments-sent-from-a-phone.jpg><p>If you've been posting the same or similar comments to your favorite creator's videos, YouTube might automatically flag it as spam. That's because although repetitive comments show your devotion to your idol, they can annoy other users as they find it irrelevant.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Furthermore, if your comments contain links to questionable sites, or if you're posting comments that link to a channel or video but isn't related to the video you're commenting on, then that is considered spam too.</p><p>You can check out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Spam Policies</a> here so that you can understand better. Remember, whenever you're posting anything on the internet, you should always think before you click. That way, you can avoid the hassle of getting banned from your favorite platforms.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is a YouTube Spambot? How Can You Stop Them?</a></span></p><h3 id=inappropriate-words>Inappropriate Words</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/typing-rude-comments-on-a-laptop.jpg><p>Some creators can automatically block inappropriate words in their videos. This helps ensure that the discussion in their videos remains civil and unheated. If that is the case, you should review the comment you're entering. Even if you didn't put any off-color or rude language in it, you might have typed in a word that the creator is sensitive about.</p><h3 id=underage-account>Underage Account</h3><p>YouTube requires users to input their age into their accounts. This way, it can ensure that it's showing age-appropriate content to you. However, if you didn't do that, the video-sharing platform automatically assumes you're a child. As such, you only get limited functions, such as the inability to access videos that are marked as not child-friendly and post comments.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>So if you can't post any comments, you should check your profile and see if you've inputted the correct birthdate for your YouTube account.</p><h3 id=a-connection-problem>A Connection Problem</h3><p>One common problem that causes commenting issues is a spotty internet connection. Even if you could watch the video, it might have buffered enough before you went offline. To determine if your device is offline, try visiting another video or opening your browser and going to a different page.</p><p>If you can't access those as well, then your poor connection is likely the culprit. You can try resetting your connection by turning on airplane mode and then turning it off again to reset your phone's antennae. Or, you could switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data or vice versa.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Home Network Problems?

That way, you know the context of the entire video. Sometimes, YouTube considers leaving comments at the start of a video when watching it for the first time as suspicious activity.</p><h3 id=refresh-your-app-or-browser>Refresh Your App or Browser</h3><p>Sometimes, an intermittent connection can cause errors when you're loading a YouTube video. While it lets you watch the video completely, it might not let you have YouTube's complete functionality. That means you might run into errors when liking, sharing, or commenting on the video.</p><p>If that is the case, the best solution is to refresh the browser or app you're using. That way, you can clear the errors before you try posting your comment again.</p><h3 id=use-a-different-browser>Use a Different Browser</h3><p>Sometimes, internal errors in a browser can cause issues like the inability to post comments. So if you're using Google Chrome or Safari, try opening the video on Microsoft Edge or Opera instead.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you've tried refreshing the app, but you still get errors, try opening the video in a different browser instead.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best Chromium Browser Alternatives Better Than Chrome</a></span></p><h3 id=try-commenting-on-other-videos>Try Commenting on Other Videos</h3><p>While rare, the creator could have deactivated the ability to comment on the video you're watching while you're trying to post the comment. If that's the case, then you can't comment at all.</p><p>To know if that is the issue, try opening other videos first commenting there. If you have no problems with that, that's the most probable answer to your problem. Unfortunately, you can't fix this—the only way you can post a comment is if the channel owner activates the function again.</p><h3 id=disable-vpns-adblockers-and-other-extensions>Disable VPNs, Adblockers, and Other Extensions</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Google-Chrome-Extensions.jpg><p>While these plug-ins and add-ons are helpful for most people, they sometimes interfere with a website's operation. If you have these running in the background and constantly run into commenting issues, try turning them off temporarily.</p><h3 id=sign-out-and-sign-in-again>Sign Out and Sign In Again</h3><p>Often, the solution to computer errors relies on a simple reset. So if any of the above tips don't help you, signing out of your account and then signing in again will fix it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=clear-cache>Clear Cache</h3><p>If the previous tip didn't work, you should go for the nuclear option. When you clear the cache of your browser, you're removing all its saved data, thereby removing your pre-saved sign-ins.</p><p>While it is inconvenient because you'll have to sign in to all your accounts again, doing so could clear any conflicting saved information on your PC and finally allow you to post your comments.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Clear Cookies and Cache in Chrome</a></span></p><h2 id=be-careful-while-showing-your-support-on-youtube>Be Careful While Showing Your Support on YouTube</h2><p>Commenting on your favorite creator's videos and interacting with your fellow fans to build a community is an excellent way to show your support. However, ensure that you're not breaking any policies and guidelines when you do that.</p><p>When talking with other users on the internet, always keep things civil. Don't turn to name-calling and cyberbullying if you can't agree with someone. After all, you could be fighting against trolls whose primary goal is only to rile you up. If things are heading that way, it's best to keep your peace and walk away.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiamqakYr2wv9NmsKitpKqvpnnCqKSmnZ6peqe112g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
