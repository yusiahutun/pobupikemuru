When the public and his well-wishers did not see him, everyone was in despair, thinking that something terrible had happened to him.</p><p>Several news channels, media, and people made all sorts of theories and conspiracies. But none of them found any proof regarding the issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/bisondele1.jpg><p>However, after a month, the public heard unfortunate news when the media circulated the information by saying that Bison was dead.</p><p>Bison’s death was confirmed when the authorities, who searched him, found only the boat but not the passenger’s sign.</p><p>Likewise, Bison was not the only one in the boat; there were two other persons. Those people were his girlfriend, Serena Karlan, and boat captain Bertrand Saldo.</p><h3>Investigation</h3><p>After many investigations, in September 2002, the investigators found shocking news.</p><p>On 5th September 2002, the man calling himself to be the Bison Dele was spotted in Pheonix. He had Bison’s passport and checkbook.</p><p>Though the man claiming to be Bison somewhat resembled him but wasn’t the real Bison.</p><p>Shockingly, the man was none other than Miles Dabord, the older brother of Bison.</p><p>During the five years of investigation, Miles stated that he was attempting to buy the Gold Eagle Coins from Certified Mint Inc for $152k on Bison’s behalf.</p><p>After hearing the statement, Miles left the station with the approval of the Pheonix Police Department.</p><p>However, police authorities came to know that Miles was the matching description of the man spotted at the Pearl Resort in Moorea on 8th July 2002.</p><p>The man who left the boat into Phaeton Bay on Tahiti’s Southeastern shore was Miles, as per the news published on Si.com.</p><p>At that time, he registered his name as Aria Bella. After leaving the boat, he flew to Los Angeles.</p><p>All of the events became evidence to prove that Miles was also on the boat that day.</p><p>After facing interrogation by the police, Miles headed to Mexico.</p><p>Before this, he met his girlfriend, Erica Wiese, as well. Police were searching for him, but he died on his way due to an overdose.</p><h2>Bison Dele’s Murder’s Proof</h2><p>Though the main suspicious person, Miles, died out of nowhere, his girlfriend became the second lead in the case. She stated that Miles was the one to kill Bison.</p><p>As per Erica, Miles and Bison argued while sailing in Tahiti. During the fight, Miles unintentionally punched Bison’s girlfriend, Serena, which killed her instantly.</p><p>Then, Miles killed Shaldon, the boat captain, by hitting him on the wall. After that, he murdered Bison in self-defense. And Miles dumped all three bodies.</p><p>Hence, it is believed that the basketball legend, Bison, was murdered by his older brother, Miles Dabord.</p><h2>Personal Life | Girlfriend & More</h2><p>Bison Dele dated several women, including singers and artists, but he never found what he sought in them.</p><p>He sought his soulmate, the one who could understand him deeply. But he kept searching for his soulmate until 1997.</p><p>In 1997, Bison found the woman he was looking for. They both were in a relationship till the last moment of their life.</p><h3>Who Was Bison Dele Dating?</h3><p>The late athlete was dating an elegant and unique woman, Serena Karlan. He encountered Serena for the first time in 1997 in Los Angeles while wandering with one of his friends.</p><p>Bison falls in love with Serena when she asks something that wrecks his soul. She questioned him if he had ever experienced the weird emotion of being alone in a room full of people.</p><p>After hearing the most related question, Bison answered, ‘Yes, exactly.’ At the time, the late player found the short conversation so meaningful that he knew Serena was the one who could understand him better than anyone.</p><h3>Patch Up-Death</h3><p>In 1997, Bison and Serena started having feelings for each other. However, with time, they began facing difficulties in communication as they were in different professions.</p><p>The late basketball player was in the NBA, whereas Serena searched for her desired job. Eventually, Bison and Serena were out of touch for many personal reasons.</p><p>However, there is a saying, ‘If it is meant to be, it will be.’ The Lord indeed wrote their love story with perfection. After being separated for almost three years, the couple reunited in 2001.</p><p>In September 2001, Bison contacted his sweetheart, Serena, to join him in New Zealand. Serena accepted the invitation with a happy heart and flew to him for two weeks.</p><p>Though she visited Bison with the thought of staying with him for two weeks, she waited for five weeks in real.</p><p>After being together for five weeks, Serena returned to her home. Again, she received a call from Bison within a few weeks.</p><p>And she left for New Zealand in early 2002 to accompany and wander to find the purpose of life with the late player.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bison and Serena never returned from their trip to Tahiti.
