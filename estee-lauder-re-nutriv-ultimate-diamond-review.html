Like the other products in the line, the Infusion too harnesses the power of truffles, but it has the added bonus of peach flower extract, which Lauder scientists are hailing as an anti-aging wonder at the cellular level. At $405, it's one of the most expensive products in the entire Lauder line.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the beauty world is full of sticker-shock products housed in sleek packaging with lofty but unfounded claims, this isn't one of them. Estée Lauder scientists are industry leaders in anti-aging research, specifically in the field of epigenetics. "We were the first in the cosmetic industry to introduce epigenetics in 2009. Epigenetic study is understanding how the environment is influencing skin cells and their behavior," says Dr. Nadine Pernodet, Ph.D., the Vice President of Skin Biology and BioActives at the Estée Lauder Companies. "Genetics will only influence the aging process by 10 to 20 percent. Epigenetics has the major influence between 70 to 90 percent. It's still controversial in the scientific world, but it's between 70 to 90 percent of how your skin is going to behave and how your skin is going to age."</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">ESTEE LAUDER Re-Nutriv - Ultimate Diamond Transformative Energy Creme</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$405 at esteelauder.com for Re-Nutriv - Ultimate Diamond Transformative Energy Creme" data-href=https://www.esteelauder.com/product/677/35120/product-catalog/re-nutriv/skincare/face-cremes/re-nutriv/ultimate-diamond-transformative-energy-creme data-product-url=https://www.esteelauder.com/product/677/35120/product-catalog/re-nutriv/skincare/face-cremes/re-nutriv/ultimate-diamond-transformative-energy-creme data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.esteelauder.com%2Fproduct%2F677%2F35120%2Fproduct-catalog%2Fre-nutriv%2Fskincare%2Fface-cremes%2Fre-nutriv%2Fultimate-diamond-transformative-energy-creme" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$405 at esteelauder.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.esteelauder.com/product/677/35120/product-catalog/re-nutriv/skincare/face-cremes/re-nutriv/ultimate-diamond-transformative-energy-creme data-vars-ga-product-brand="ESTEE LAUDER" data-vars-ga-product-id=2773780c-fb6f-4337-a55d-247110c0acc1 data-vars-ga-product-price=$405.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=2dec9fb2-cbaa-49d6-ab92-bfc5f6e33f49 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="ESTEE LAUDER" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Sexual Wellness" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=ultimate-diamond-transformative-energy-creme data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Re-Nutriv - Ultimate Diamond Transformative Energy Creme" title="Re-Nutriv - Ultimate Diamond Transformative Energy Creme" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1574369104-cf5a9b11-2ae2-490b-8f6d-b213c4bc8748-1574369094.jpg width=1660 height=2546 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">ESTEE LAUDER Re-Nutriv - Ultimate Diamond Transformative Energy Creme</h2></p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Patented Technology</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Using this research, Lauder has been manipulating our skin cells for over a decade to make them function like much younger skin cells, even in harsh environments. In 2008, the company introduced the first sirtuin (a protein) activator that helps boost your skin's ability to renew and repair itself. Two years later, Lauder introduced a second technology that helps restore skin's natural ability to produce clean cell-repairing energy without creating free radicals. In 2014, they began to find ways to maintain cellular telomere length to slow down aging. In this new dual serum, Lauder is unveiling something called the SIRT-2 activator, a patented formula, to help restore the skin cell's natural structure and shape. Because you don't need a microscope to know that young skin cells look quite different than old skin cells.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They also behave differently too: older, misshapen cells produce much less collagen and are more susceptible to environmental damage. If you can get the cell to never lose its young and perky shape, you can literally stave off the microscopic damage that leads to loss of collagen, elastic, and youthfulness. "The sign of a young healthy cell is the shape. The shape is going to dictate the function of the cell," says Pernodet. "We know the aging process starts in your late twenties. Things are starting to change but you don't see visible effects yet. Between 30 to 40, this is a critical time to make sure we can conserve the young skin and help to repair the young skin."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The perfect SIRT-2 activator was found in Asia from an extract of the peach flower. "This peach flower extract is extremely potent in activating and supporting SIRT-2 in skin cells and helping to rebuild the skin cell structure and shape," says Pernodet. In an in vitro study directly on cells, one application of the extract was able to double the size of skin cells in just under 12 hours, making 62 year-old skin look more like 45 year-old skin. All three SIRT activators and the truffle extract are found on one side of the serum's tube. The other side houses a refining and brightening serum to help the potent extracts penetrate the skin.</p><img alt="Mushroom black truffle - Rare and expensive vegetable" title="Mushroom black truffle - Rare and expensive vegetable" width=2832 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mushroom-black-truffle-rare-and-expensive-vegetable-royalty-free-image-1574369204.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Esperanza33</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How Can Truffles Impact Skin Health?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Truffles have been harvested for thousands of years for their medicinal qualities. Mushrooms as a whole are unlike any other plant or animal on Earth, each containing entirely unique and powerful nutrients. When consumed regularly, they could help <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5937616/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="boost immunity and anticancer function of cells" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">boost immunity and anticancer function of cells</a>, as well as decrease inflammation. "In France, kings throughout history were eating truffles not just because it was an aphrodisiac, but to make sure they could have a child to be the next king," she says. But Pernodet and her team wanted to make a case for not just ingesting truffles, but applying them topically, too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When we started this research, we took many, many truffles to see if there is some strength that they give to skin to help against aging. We sourced many different truffles from many different areas and the one that gave us the most activity was the black diamond truffle," says Pernodet. "Black diamond truffle extract supports the ATP production in the skin cells. When you expose skin cells to an environment such as UV, UV is going to kill the ATP production by the cells which means they have no more energy to repair and they are going to accumulate more damage and age faster. The truffle is giving an increase to the ATP production."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Where Do the Truffles Come From?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Estée Lauder sources their black diamond truffles from an exclusive farmer in the south of France. From January to February each year, the farmer ships mature and fresh (never frozen!) truffles to Lauder's laboratory in the area so they can start the extraction process when the nutrients and molecules are the most potent.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Skin Results</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've been testing the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.esteelauder.com/product/661/67972/product-catalog/re-nutriv/re-nutriv/ultimate-diamond-transformative-energy-dual-infusion data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ultimate Diamond Transformative Energy Dual Infusion" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ultimate Diamond Transformative Energy Dual Infusion</a> as well as the eye cream and moisturizer daily for over a month, and the results are very promising. Right after application, my combination-dry skin feels soft and soothed. But after a few days, my skin looked brighter, clearer, and the pesky fine lines under my eyes and around my mouth are far less noticeable. The formulas do contain other common skin care ingredients like lactic acid, peptides, and glycerin, as well as a blend of plant extracts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've gone without wearing makeup on several public occasions and received compliments from total strangers on the texture and quality of my skin. The products are expensive but effective, so use them sparingly but regularly for the best results. I like using the serum and eye cream twice a day and the moisturizer only at night. The fragrance is minimal unlike many other anti-aging treatments, but there is no SPF in the formula, so be sure to apply an additional sunscreen with an SPF value of at least 30.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital.
