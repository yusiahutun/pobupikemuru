Back in the 1990s, he and other band members had captured the hearts of young girls in their thousands, both in the United States and internationally. But throughout his life as a <a href=#>musician</a>, Ralph has always been a taken man.</p><p class=align-left>Tresvant has been married twice and is currently in his third official relationship. Ralph Tresvant's first wife was Shelly, his sweetheart from way back, with whom he had three children. His second wife was Amber, and they went separate ways after almost two decades together. At the moment, Ralph is dating Monique.</p><h2>Who were Ralph Tresvant's wives?</h2><p class=align-left>So far, Ralph has been in three formal <a href=#>relationships</a>. Two of these led to marriage, while the third and current relationship is set to be made official at their convenient time.

He was first involved with Shelly Jean, his <a href=# title="Ralph Tresvant's wife" rel="nofollow noopener">childhood sweetheart</a>, whom he dated for several years before finally tying the knot in 1993. The couple welcomed three kids from the marriage.</p><p class=align-left>Despite having children, the marriage was still a bumpy one. Marital issues made the couple part ways just three years into the union in 1996. Most of his followers and music fans believe that the separation resulted from his secret affair with Amber.</p><h3>Amber Serrano</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/813cb7d229e05335.jpg><p class=align-left>It wasn't long after Ralph Tresvant divorced Shelly before the singer moved on with his new chick, Amber. This move further fueled the rumours that the two were seeing each other even before concluding his first marriage. Ralph met Amber when she was just <a id=https://www.essence.com/celebrity/black-celeb-couples/new-edition-wives/#62596 href=# title="Ralph Tresvant's wife" rel="nofollow noopener">13 years old</a> and an ardent fan of the RnB group.

The visual art designer and virtual artist later resurfaced and crossed paths with Ralph later when he was already married to Shelly. The couple described their reunion as an embarrassing moment for the lass. Apparently, she slid and fell down a staircase, and Ralph, who was around at the moment, had to confirm if she was okay.</p><p class=align-left>That's when the two exchanged contacts, and this was the beginning of their 8-year long dating journey that finally materialized into marriage. The couple got married in 2004 in a <a href=# title="Ralph Tresvant's wife" rel="nofollow noopener">double wedding</a> with another member of the New Edition RnB group, Ricky Bell, who was tying the knot with his sweetheart Amy Correa.</p><p class=align-left>Notably, the two welcomed a son five years before tying the knot.
