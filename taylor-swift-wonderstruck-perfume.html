Wanna smell like Swift? Well, you can once the singer releases Wonderstruck, her debut signature scent, this October. The name of the aroma was derived from the lyrics of her song 'Enchanted,' and judging from the description of the perfume and the scent notes it contains, it's probably going to smell divine, as its inspiration is utterly and incredibly romantic.<span id=more-37681></span></p><p>In a statement, Swift said, "I wrote the lyric, 'I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home' for the song 'Enchanted' about the first time you meet someone. A fragrance can help shape someone's first impression and memory of you. It's exciting to think that Wonderstruck will play a role in creating some of those memories."</p><p>Swift also explained her thought processes for shaping the scent, saying, "I share personal life experiences through my music, and my fragrance will allow me to share these experiences with my fans in a completely different and new way. Falling in love is a moment every girl daydreams about and Wonderstruck represents that magical feeling of promise and hope and intrigue." Romantic, indeed. At least Swift has devised a specific and thought-out idea for her scent, making it that much more personal.</p><p>This Eau de Swift was inspired by some of the ringleted songbird's favorite memories and smells. Scent is the sense that is most closely tied to memory, and Swift's fragrance is certainly playing up that fact. Wonderstruck is a woody and fruity floral, meshing notes of freesia, apple blossom and raspberry with vanilla, sun drenched honeysuckle and white hibiscus. There are also layers of golden amber, sandalwood and lush peach. Mmm, can't you just imagine what it smells like? Fall can't get here soon enough.</p><p>What's inside the regal purple and gold round bottle is special enough, but the bottle itself is a work of adorable art, laced with charms and a never-before-used iridescent rainbow finish which allows for a lit-from-within glow. The always-stylish Swift chose the charms herself, which include a Moravian star, dove and birdcage. The package is also stamped with a gold 13, which is Swift's lucky number. Swift fans will love adorning their bureaus with this stunning bottle. Overall, Wonderstruck is as decorative as it is deliciously scented, and so perfectly Taylor.</p><p>One thing worth mentioning regarding celebrity fragrances: they don't stop at one. Most pop divas – <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>,<a href=#> Britney Spears</a> -- have released at least half a dozen signature scents and are now fragrance moguls running scent empires. So while this is Swift's first fragrance, it's probably not her last.</p><p><strong>Watch Taylor Swift Perform 'Enchanted'<br></strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXay8r7DEq6qtqqWYuG68xKudrqWVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
