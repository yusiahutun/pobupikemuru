The following year, Louis told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">The Times</a> he had "nothing to do with" Ronan and referred to the singer as a "<strong>little manufactured pop star who actually believed his own publicity</strong>".&nbsp;</p><p id=eiN0MKGmlhw data-wc=41>"Ronan thought he was George Michael. He didn't write his own songs," he said. "I picked all his songs. I picked every single hit he had. He said he didn't want to be a karaoke artist. Well, that's what he is."</p><p id=eqPMmtFx2pZ data-wc=57>Ronan also didn't hold back and later told magazine: "That man absolutely tried to ruin me and if he thinks we can ever hug and make up he can forget it. I haven't heard from him in three years and I wouldn't have a problem if I never saw him again. He's not a nice character."</p><h3 dir=ltr>Feud with Girls Aloud</h3><p id=e8PKWHT5Ubu data-wc=64>Louis's feud with Girls Aloud is thought to have started over a decade ago when he was managing the band and made a comment about their appearances. <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Kimberley Walsh</a> previously told BUILD Series LDN: "We were doing our video for Love Machine in 2004 and Louis Walsh waltzed in and said to us, '<strong>Oh, none of you are fat any more!</strong> Brilliant, that's great.'"</p><p id=eibTiKF7XGYN data-wc=32>Louis then went on to judge alongside <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Cheryl</a> on , and the pair famously bickered across the judging panel, with co-star <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Simon Cowell</a> even comparing them to Tom and Jerry.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1b68daf86236-louis-walsh-x-factor.jpg><p id=e08wZ_NWcBCo data-wc=62>In December last year, the Irish TV personality admitted that he doesn't keep in touch with Cheryl. "<strong>I don't have a relationship with Cheryl, I don't bother</strong>," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Ladbrokes</a>. "I haven't seen her, I haven't heard from her. We didn't get on great on X Factor because she didn't get the fun of it. She didn't understand that side of it."</p><h3 dir=ltr>Defamation case and impact on mental health</h3><p id=eYAVmOjEK0FN data-wc=55>In June 2011, Louis was falsely accused of sexually assaulting a man in the toilets of a Dublin nightclub in a story published in . While the TV star received over £400,000 in libel damages and the man was later imprisoned for the false accusation, the story had lasting effects on Louis's mental health.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1e802d2aeeb5-louis-walsh-d.jpg><p id=eslfArUZKCrZ data-wc=55>"There was one particular moment when I was in the hotel in London, in The Kensington, and I was watching Sky News and I was on it - it was the front page of The Sun - and I was thinking, <strong>'No one is going to believe me'</strong>," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">The Belfast Telegraph</a> in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p id=e31oRMvJdO1F data-wc=83>"<strong>I didn't know I was going to get out of the dark place</strong>, but Paul Tweed and Gavin Bonnar got me and they sorted me out. Without them, I wouldn't have got through it. Simon was totally supportive, and Elton John called me the following day. He said, 'I know what happened. I know it's not true. This is my mobile number.' It was great to get a bit of support. It was the greatest reality check I've ever had in my life."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
