Taking place in pairs of two (or more) eclipses, the season of change arrives every six months, paving the way for the universe to make adjustments to your reality. If you’re one of the <a href=#>zodiac</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> signs affected by the total solar eclipse in Aries</a> the most, then get ready for the ride of your life, because you’ve got a date with destiny.</p><p>In astrology, eclipses are far more than a mesmerizing and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mysterious celestial phenomenon</a>. In fact, these interruptions to our regularly scheduled programming are always a signal that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">change is about to occur</a>. A solar eclipse always unfolds in place of a new moon, while <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>a lunar eclipse always occurs</a> instead of a full moon. These glitches in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>our typical 28-day lunar cycle</a> are a sign that nothing is in our control and all we can do is allow the chips to fall where they may. Plunging you into the deepest shade of your shadow self, an eclipse always forces you to see the truth. And once your eyes adjust to the dark, it all begin to make sense.</p><p>An eclipse almost always takes place in the same zodiac sign as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the North Node</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the South Node</a>, which unlocks the door to your potential and sets you free from inhibiting attachments. While the South Node symbolizes our past lives and former experiences, the North Node guides us toward the future. And because an eclipse brings you to a crossroads on your karmic path, it speeds you up toward your ultimate destiny, often when you least expect it. While the changes that unfold under an eclipse can be overwhelming, they can feel just as exciting as they do fear-inducing. All you can do is have faith that no matter where you’re headed, it will be beautiful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-33.png><p>Arriving on April 8 at 2:21 p.m. ET, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>a total solar eclipse in Aries</a> will land at 19 degrees, taking place just four degrees away from the North Node in Aries. Because the North Node represents the energy we, as a collective, are moving toward and creating more space for, this eclipse may feel like a forceful shove in the right direction, taking you somewhere far away from our comfort zone. You’re being called to let go of what has been holding you back; to shed your skin and set yourself free from the inhibiting confines of your past.</p><p>Every eclipse is difficult, but this one is a different beast entirely. Taking place at the same exact degree as Chiron—the wounded healer—this eclipse is stripping us bare and bringing up some of our deepest vulnerabilities. Healing is on the way, but healing is often a painful and meandering process. Luckily, there’s always plenty of beauty scattered along the way. And because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mars—planet of conflict</a>—will also be forming a conjunction with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Saturn—planet of restriction</a>—in boundless and emotional Pisces, there are sure to be conflicts of the mind, body, and soul. A Mars-Saturn conjunction would be difficult in and of itself, but a total solar eclipse happening alongside it? That’s next level intensity. Something powerful is on the verge of beginning and a breakthrough is on the way. Get ready for the good, the bad, and the ugly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=these-4-zodiac-signs-will-feel-the-solar-eclipse-the-most>These 4 Zodiac Signs Will Feel the Solar Eclipse the Most</h2><p>If your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun sign</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>moon sign</a>, North Node, South Node or—most importantly—your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> falls under any of the following zodiac signs, the upcoming total solar eclipse in Aries could spark a major transformation in your life.

And even though it’s about to get very busy in your life, you’re fully capable of handling what comes next. When a solar eclipse takes place in your first house of the self, it can represent the beginning of a major identity shift. If an unexpected change begins to unfold in your life, it’s designed to awaken you from complacency and become the person you were always meant to become. And while a solar eclipse can lead to something big and monumental happening, its impact can also be simple and subtle, yet deeply personal. Give yourself time to shed your skin, Aries. You’ve outgrown your current circumstances and you’re ready to try something new; something much more suited to the person you’re becoming. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full yearly horoscope for 2024</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.7944501541624><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_cancer.png><p>You’re making a name for yourself, Cancer.

And because this solar eclipse takes place in Aries—your opposite sign—it’s jumpstarting the engine in your seventh house of significant others, such as allies, enemies, spouses and exes. Is a major change culminating in a relationship? Do you find yourself wanting to break free from a commitment you’ve made to someone? While this solar eclipse may indicate that you’re ready to sever ties with someone, it could also mean that a relationship is evolving into something different; something stronger and more critical. Either way, this solar eclipse is going to each you so much about what makes a relationship come together (and what causes it to fall apart).

Taking place in your fourth house of home, family, and subconscious programming, this solar eclipse may be the harbinger of a change in your domestic dynamic. You might be ready to move to a new place, welcome a new family member or simply redesign your living space. It could even indicate that you’re ready to leave behind your hometown and move to a city for an exciting new opportunity. However, as you leave behind your nest and venture into the unknown, it’s important to remember that it could take time for your new life to take root. Even if you’re simply throwing out the proverbial garbage and deep cleaning your apartment, the process could certainly bring up some complicated emotions. Either way, you’re learning that home is not necessarily a place, but a state of mind. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full yearly horoscope for 2024</a>.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfqLytrdFmnJykmaXApnnZqJuimZNiwKqzzaxkpqejqXqissWemq2dlGKusb7IpWRraGJpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
