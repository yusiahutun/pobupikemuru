The conceptual album was crafted over two years and details the 29-year-old’s search for self in an industry and society he calls “harsh”, especially during the pandemic years, when he traded the United States for Shanghai.
“The environment I grew up in was always optimistic and forward-looking – I had felt that the world would be steadily progressing and becoming better,” says Leo1Bee, born Zhang Siyuan, in northeastern China."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Upon graduation, he convinced his parents that music production could be a moneymaking skill and career. So began his move to the Berklee College of Music’s international campus in Valencia, Spain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Spanish arts hub was where Zhang perfected his self-taught composition and arrangement skills – something that he had been wanting to do since being exposed to Taiwan’s R&B-infused pop music by his cousins in the early 2000s, ruled by the likes of Jay Chou and Yu Quan.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">He’s like a K-pop idol for classical music fans – meet Danny Koo</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Listening to Taiwan’s David Tao and Hong Kong’s Khalil Fong, who are credited with popularising rhythm and blues in Chinese-speaking regions, allowed Zhang to develop what he calls a “real awareness” of his love for the genre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang would then grow to admire the work of Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and D’Angelo, and by the time he moved from Valencia to New York he was an all-in-one package who could sing, write and produce, and having spent his early adult years across three continents, the pensive musician now thinks of himself an “observer to world changes”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/16/3675d5be-4999-4405-a6e4-1ea52d419ec5_35f23047.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a string of well-received singles and extended plays, as well as two tours spanning cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, Zhang released his debut album last October on streaming platforms, with vinyls in the works. The sequencing takes the listener through a night of introspection, which begins at sunset – as Zhang enters a state of confusion and breakdown – and ends at dawn, by which time he has narratively rebuilt and restored himself.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To Zhang, sunsets symbolise his realisation of the mismatch between the harsh realities of life and the fantasies he had about the world as a child. “Values and aspirations can be fragile in the face of real life,” he says. “Wilderness encompasses my journey of examining myself and my environment over the couple of years after I graduated. In a culture where the majority of people listen to music that you don’t like or don’t want to produce, how do you remain yourself?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Zhang has “remained himself”, or at least so it seems. Wilderness is saturated with poetic lyrics and elegant melodies that were clearly not made to serve mass – perhaps mindless – consumption.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">My perspective is that this album will inspire, especially with its sound … it’s a new dimensionLeo1Bee, aka Zhang Siyuan</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“False God”, which appears in the middle of the album and symbolises Zhang’s passage from turmoil to clarity, is the work he is most proud of, he says. It critiques how narrowly society views joy, success and stability.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“‘False God’ is about me pushing away a value or moral system that was imposed on me, I wanted to oppose this sort of ideological authority,” says the musician whose first degree – in advertising – was never something he desired.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/16/7a319c86-0e82-4f7f-a8ee-dcd00a3c34db_28961ee7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rock-infused tune begins with Zhang challenging the “superficial ideals” of society, which, he says, “arms itself with ignorance”. He sings: “Is the pursuit of knowledge the most primitive human instinct that we bury? And since I am human, why am I forbidden from asking questions?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In music, it is only when I can fully express my ideas as I intended that I can feel a sense of achievement and joy,” says Zhang, adding, “all the songs on the album were written around this concept”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang has hopes for the album to have “cultural meaning”: “It is not about the numbers I can do with the album, or its commercial value […] My perspective is that this album will inspire, especially with its sound – if it is to be defined as an R&B album, its sound is one that Chinese R&B has not heard – it’s a new dimension.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">She’s written songs for everyone from the Jackson 5 to Jacky Cheung</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Choose Your Weapon (2015), the critically acclaimed album by Australian neo-soul quartet Hiatus Kaiyote that deeply influenced Zhang, uses a similar approach, taking influence from a variety of genres including jazz, soul, R&B, progressive rock, West African funk, samba and Latin grooves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rippling in Mandopop circles, Zhang has also written, produced, arranged and engineered tunes for some of China’s biggest pop stars, including Bibi Zhou and Roy Wang.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite having been trained at a prestigious music institute, Zhang says he has benefited from the industry’s barriers to entry being lowered in recent years – as an independent artist without a major label’s backing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It sounds contradictory saying it, but I actually quite welcome this phenomenon of people making music as amateurs – everyone doesn’t necessarily have to understand everything, music made without full [scholarly knowledge] can also serve us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOmqmtq12iwrS1wmiYq6yZmLmme5JrbHJpaW58rbHOapmenV2dtrR5zZ6uZpmcl8Kuedaio52doqOytL%2BMq5ydnZaeu6q6xmaaoaGemsCmedGbZJqmlGK%2FprnAoqWippdiwbPBxGafoqWjmrmni8yom66klXK5osDErKtfqJepxrGxnKGmpp2glrSm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
