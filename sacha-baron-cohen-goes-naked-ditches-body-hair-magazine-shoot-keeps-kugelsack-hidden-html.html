 Sacha Baron Cohen isn't afraid to throw himself into a role - even if means getting rid of his body hair and his clothes in the process.
To promote his latest movie, Bruno, the funnyman gets naked and poses in character on the cover of GQ magazine."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I turned my head away from the screen at that one.</p><p>You have to take your hat off, or something like that, to Cohen for having the gumption to put himself, or rather Bruno, through that. Yes, there's a lot of exposure of rear ends, and front ends.</p><p>The point is to shock, to make your cringe in your seat, to shake your head and go, 'No, he's not going to do that, is he'?! Oh, yes he is, my God, he did.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/03/article-0-0440246A000005DC-497_468x511.jpg alt="Sacha Baron Cohen" width=468 height=511 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Not afraid of controversy: Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen mocks Madonna's adoption of an African child in his new movie Bruno</p><p>I emailed a friend in New York after I saw the picture last night and his immediate response was, 'Is it as funny as Borat'?</p><p>My reaction was a simple, 'No'. Frankly, they're very different films, channelling very different humour. Different laughs. Both, though, employ the kind of provocative ambush tactics that have made Cohen famous.</p><p>An interview with a supermodel Heather Hahn backstage at a fashion show was spot on. It beautifully hammered her without her realising it. Bruno suggested it must be difficult being a supermodel.</p><p>'Oh, yes,' Heather replied, 'It's very hard standing in heels all day.'</p><p>Bruno struck back, 'Yes, you have to put your left leg in front of your right leg.'</p><p>That made me roar. In an instant, he skewered her. It was funny precisely because she had no clue.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/03/article-1166993-0442B56B000005DC-475_468x286.jpg alt=Bruno width=468 height=286 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Brave: Bruno tells a group of camouflage clad men they're just like the girls off Sex and the City</p><p>Bruno soon tires of Europe and heads to Los Angeles where he gets an agent and tries out interviewing D-list celebrities such as Paula Abdul and LaToya Jackson.</p><p>Whether they were in on the joke was hard to discern but the scenes worked because they checked into our perception that these D-listers will do anything, almost, for TV exposure.</p><p>Bruno has them sit on Mexican workers, yes, real live people bending over to form human chairs because the house Bruno's rented has no furniture.</p><p>Bruno then ambushes Harrison Ford as he exits a store. Ford tells him to ,'F**k Off'. Sharp, hilarious.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/03/article-1166993-04402466000005DC-255_468x309.jpg alt=Bruno width=468 height=309 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=imageCaption>Sticky situation: Bruno caused mayhem at Milan Fashion week while wearing a Velcro suit</p><p>What Cohen wants to do is to use Bruno's stereotypical camp gay persona to expose the intolerance of the typical red-blooded male. These scenes don't work all of the time, some misfire.</p><p>The one set in an army recruitment centre works, so does a set-up where Bruno goes camping (ha, ha) with a group of deer-hunting red-necks. He provokes them into running him,and his camera crew, right out of the camp. I laughed. But, later I figured I'd have reacted the same way if some bloke, stark naked, started unzipping my tent and asked if I wanted to play. So, what exactly was I laughing at here?</p><p>I thought the film worked best as an expose of our superficial, celebrity culture particularly when Bruno produces an African-American baby, he calls OJ, and takes him around LA.Thirteen pounds of black gold, he calls him.</p><p>Bruno meets parents of baby models, pretending he wants to hire the kids for a photographic shoot .'Is your baby comfortable with bees, wasps, and hornets?'</p><p>The mother in question agrees that her child&nbsp; is 'comfortable with everything '.</p><p>The most shocking encounter (well, it shocked the bejeezus out of me) came when Bruno asks another mother whether her baby daughter could lose ten pounds in one week. 'Yeah', she agrees.</p><p>Then Bruno wonders if liposuction could be used. 'Whatever it takes to get the booking', the woman replies.</p><p>I thought I had seen, or heard, just about everything in Hollywood, but these parents willing to sell their offspring into anything that would provide them with a living, sickened me.</p><p>This was Bruno at its best. The TV appearance on a day-time Dallas talk show that follows is priceless.</p><p>Bruno isn't as funny as it thinks it is all of the time, even though I noticed one of its producers sitting in front of me laughing his head off at scenes on-screen that weren't in the least bit amusing to me.</p><p>Each to his own, I guess.</p><p><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhqcWNnhnJ7spqaoZldd66zu81meqiglaN6qLvErGSnmZuasW6wyK2aoZ2jYq%2BwsNhmn5qhomK6orPAs6CnnV2otbC702ainp2gqHqswcaeo6yZk6B6qbXDnZynZpipuq0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
