The reality star revealed she swapped chocolate bars for protein bars and exchanged her usual white baps for sourdough bread.</p><p id=ek_nZQ1adWO6 data-wc=141>Sharing a throwback photo on Instagram in November 2018 of herself looking visibly heavier, Adele, who is <a class=hm-link href=#>dating Kate Holderness</a>, opened up about her weight loss journey. She said at the time: "Hi everybody! Past Adele just wanted to wish you a very happy #throwbackthursday. I’ve just told her she’s going to run two marathons in the future. She’s just (expletive) herself laughing and gone straight to the bottom shelf on that cake stand. It’s never too late to change. Going to take her back to this very spot one day and recreate this photo. Just need to find that bloody t-shirt. It was my favourite. Wore it for Kate’s birthday. Thought I was being dead fancy because it’s got Nike in gold on it. Currently telling the story of how this little cherub went from cake stands to WAKING THE (expletive) UP."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=e8K26wZEx-Tq data-wc=6><strong>Adele lost an incredible two stone</strong></p><p id=ejQYfYvGJAM0 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>I'm a Celebrity's Caitlyn Jenner opens up about tragic death of her brother</a></strong></p><p id=eDSyS8153Q8N data-wc=119>Following her weight loss, Adele took part in a BBC documentary about female bodybuilding, in which she underwent a 30-day challenge. Once she finished the challenge, she told the BBC: "I used to be quite naughty before I started it. I had to get a whole new diet which I had to stick to daily and a training regime involving cardio and weight lifting. I get up at 2am so it made it that little bit tougher. Early breakfast is such a gruelling shift and I know it sounds silly but not seeing the sun and having to work while everyone else is still sleeping is a really weird thing. It’s draining and it tends to make you emotional."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=eHl2qdCVzGF2 data-wc=6><strong>Adele overhauled her lifestyle in 2017</strong></p><p id=eBma7Un1YQWa data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Who is I'm a Celebrity's Andrew Whyment's wife?

I thought there is no way I’m going to be able to do this. But I learned that it was just sugar and bad habits leaving my body. The hardest habit to kick was sugar. Not having sugar in my diet was really hard. I couldn’t even eat fruit or tomatoes and that killed me. I wanted to cry over the tomatoes. I imagine it’s like going cold turkey."</p><p id=ehnI-v49n_Kl data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
