According to records, his mother conceived him out of wedlock with the Duke of Plön, who’s related to the royal family of Europe due to intermarriage. Therefore, Bob has royal blood inside him, but will his mind on the monarchy change?</p><p>“[It makes me feel] like a part of history that I didn’t think I was any part of,” the 61-year-old said after learning about his relation to Plön. “I’m an American. I’m not a monarchist. I don’t believe in that. You know, I feel like it’s a little twisted.”</p><p>Expanding on his views, he said:&nbsp;“I understand why society built itself around monarchs and leaders, and they passed them down through generations. I understand that goes through every society, every civilization. But I think that we’ve gotten to a better place with democracy and we should keep going down that road.”</p><p>After sharing his views, he was then graced with the revelation that though the Duke, he and <a href=#>King Charles</a> are in fact, 11th cousins.</p><p>The star couldn’t contain his laughter as he chuckled: “Well maybe I’ll change my mind on that.”</p><p>The two then shared a joke about how Bob was “trashing his family on how they make a living,” as he called the revelation “crazy!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hilary-duff-was-once-named-america-s-most-royal-celeb>Hilary Duff was once named America’s ‘most royal’ celeb</h2><p>The Better Call Saul star isn’t the only celebrity who has traces of royalty in their blood.
