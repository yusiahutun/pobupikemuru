Through her frequent appearance in fashion week and movies, she has been considered to be a successful artist.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, none of her fan followers were aware of her age, relationship status or about her sexual preference, until now.</p><p style=text-align:justify>So,&nbsp;today let's debunk her personal and professional life of Melanie! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Wondering&nbsp;About Her Age, Wiki, and Bio?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Even though the star looks like sweet 16, she celebrates her birthday on 31st December.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Melanie, aged 37, looks like she is in her early 30s as she has maintained her body well to have an active acting and modeling career.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Michael Jackson's Daughter:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Paris Jackson Bio, Boyfriend, Mother, Net Worth" rel=follow>Paris Jackson Bio, Boyfriend, Mother, Net Worth</a></p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Even though she was frequently seen romancing her co-stars in the series&nbsp;“Wynonna Earp,” in real life, she kept her married life hidden for a long time.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She started modeling at the age of 13 and was already in the acting biz by the age&nbsp;of 16, taking auditions and shots in Ottowa, Toronto, and Montreal. She talked about how she first got into the modeling/acting career and revealed that she didn't consider the acting profession until her modeling agency pushed her for it.</p><p style=text-align:justify>"I was only 5’7” and I was never really waify, but I have quite a personality,” says Scrofano. “My agent said, ‘So you really want to be a model, eh?’ and then submitted my name whenever casting directors were looking for models to act. It was a bit of a nudge in, and what turned out to be the right direction.”&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>After her first few gigs, she was quite motivated and wanted more. She was reported saying,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“I realized how much there was to acting. You could work on it forever and never become a real actor. There’s always room for improvement,” says Scrofano. “In modeling, people tell you when you’re done. And I consider [my work as an actress] so far and see it as a gratifying exercise in extremes. In acting, the possibilities for who you portray and how you portray are limitless.”&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>In an&nbsp;interview conducted by Syfy on 16th May 2016, she&nbsp;briefed about her likes and dislike. The actress&nbsp;stated that her favorite book as a kid was “The Sword of Shannara,” whereas, her hobby was making pizza.&nbsp;She&nbsp;even disclosed her weird habit of waking up and not speaking with anyone before 10 am unless it was scripted. She&nbsp;revealed her best city as London and her desire to express the Latin language. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>"Me.
