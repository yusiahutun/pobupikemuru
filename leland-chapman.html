Despite being charged with extradition, Mexico immediately dropped all accusations when they were swiftly released on bond.

But he became a well-known showbiz personality in the US after becoming a star of the A&E Network program “Dog the Bounty Hunter.” In 2015, he and his wife Jaime relocated to Alabama, where he is still active in the bail bonds industry.</p><p><a href=#>Also View Chris Ovitz’s Net Worth, Bio, Career, and More.</a></p><h2>Who is the wife of Leland Chapman?</h2><p>After graduating, he not only started working professionally but also fell in love multiple times.
