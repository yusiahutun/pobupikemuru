There’s the hunting for the venue, the squabbling over who to add to the guest list, the flower arrangements…the list goes on!&nbsp;</p><p id=eBaGtXM7uES data-wc=59>Even for newly engaged Daria, a self-proclaimed control freak, the challenges of wedding planning became too much. "I'm your typical Type A person," Daria explains to HELLO!. "I work in PR, so it comes natural to me to take the reins, especially for big events like a wedding. I like to be in control of everything in my life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5d26a72c0fa0-img8063.jpg><p id=eF4WDhHfmcp data-wc=77>Unsurprisingly, when Daria got engaged to her fiance Andrew Brunetto, 29 who works in real estate, she assumed that she would want to take control of all of the logistics. “Andrew was happy for me to be the one in charge,” Daria explains. “He knows what I am like when it comes to organising anything - that I like to be the one behind the decisions - so he said he will happily take a step back.”</p><p id=eyZXcvagAUH data-wc=73>However, as their wedding guest list crept up to 300, Daria began to feel overwhelmed. &nbsp;“I quickly realised that organising a 300-person wedding on my own was going to be almost impossible, not to mention stressful. Even for me who loves this kind of thing! But I just didn’t know where to start with the delegations. Honestly, I didn't really want to delegate anything to Andrew, but I knew that I had to.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/977811840089-wedding-planning-d.jpg><p id=eO80FSs04d4 data-wc=76>Working in PR, Daria had already heard about the use of AI in event planning, but was sceptical about giving a robot some control over the decision-making for her wedding. “When it was first suggested by a colleague that I should use AI to help me delegate some tasks to Andrew, I thought it was a crazy idea. A wedding is such a personal occasion! Plus how on earth could AI know Andrew better than me?”</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How to plan a wedding: your ultimate checklist" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4babe3a74697-wedding-planning-planners-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How to plan a wedding: your ultimate checklist" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How to plan a wedding: your ultimate checklist</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="First steps of wedding planning are the hardest – a complete guide from start to finish" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/cfbce3965ff2-wedding-planning-first-steps-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="First steps of wedding planning are the hardest – a complete guide from start to finish" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>First steps of wedding planning are the hardest – a complete guide from start to finish</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How to plan an eco-friendly wedding day that is elegant and environmentally friendly" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/965f9f297200-bride-groom.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How to plan an eco-friendly wedding day that is elegant and environmentally friendly" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How to plan an eco-friendly wedding day that is elegant and environmentally friendly</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Real brides anonymously share their wedding day regrets" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/50424044a656-first-look-bride-groom.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Real brides anonymously share their wedding day regrets" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Real brides anonymously share their wedding day regrets</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e78NJ2N_6ZD data-wc=52>However, desperate from some help, Daria put her scepticism aside during a date night with her fiance. “We thought we would give it a go over dinner and a bottle of wine. What did we have to lose? And it actually ended up being really fun and was quite the bonding experience.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eFao7n1bHjr data-wc=63>Daria was recommended to go to the online wedding planning platform <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Zola.com&nbsp;</a>and check out their <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">‘Split the Decisions’</a> tool, which prompts couples to answer questions about their relationship dynamics and interests. Then based on this information, it strategically allocates wedding tasks, including ones that she hadn’t even thought of yet, like stamping and mailing out invites and applying for a marriage license.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7909a50c9faf-eco-wedding.jpg><p id=e_1CHGIza3t data-wc=91>“I was genuinely surprised, and I must say relieved at how it assigned the tasks so perfectly and also reminded me of all the smaller details that I needed to add to the to-do list,” Daria explains. "It assigned Andrew to find a venue, DJ and a band, which is great as it takes a huge pressure off me, plus he’s into music way more than I am. And it also assigned him to work on our guest list and table plan, which is a job that I will happily drop.”</p><p id=etGvNkvzGiR data-wc=60>And it wasn't just task delegation that Daria found helpful through the process, the use of AI strangely encouraged the couple to find a newfound appreciation for each other. “I love that Andrew is finding joy in looking for a band and looking for the venue," Daria beams, emphasising the unexpected joy and camaraderie the tool brought to their relationship.</p><p id=eQ1cFtuls53 data-wc=55>"It's essentially like a wedding planner, but better," Daria says. “Because it’s free, it helps to keep your relationship sane during stressful times, plus it’s making you think of things that you wouldn't initially think by yourself. We are now really enjoying and excited about this planning stage and can’t wait for the big day!"</p><p id=eAyUXgAz4s data-wc=16><strong>READ NEXT:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Hen dos and dont's: what real brides say about planning a memorable pre-wedding party</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
