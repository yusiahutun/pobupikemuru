Li also made it clear that the deal represented a major step towards diversifying the bourse’s business away from equities and HKEX becoming a “international bourse operator”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Unlike equities, where there are fewer concerns when corporate issuers choose to diversify their listing venues outside their home markets, commodities are often closely associated with a government’s strategic resources,” said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at investment bank China Renaissance.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">HKEX to set up two international offices to attract overseas listings</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Given that LME is a global pricing hub for metals, it would be more challenging for HKEX to serve various stakeholders through LME without first tackling scrutiny arising from various geopolitical interests,” he added.</p>A decade since the deal was concluded, Hong Kong’s success as a super-connector to China appears to not have extended to commodities, in contrast with the Hong Kong stock exchange’s triumph in equities, where it has been the top market globally for <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">initial public offerings</span></a> (IPOs) in seven out of the previous 13 years. The city is also a pre-eminent market for Chinese issuers raising funds through IPOs, as well as for mainland Chinese investors trading shares of Chinese companies not listed at home.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nicolas Aguzin, HKEX’s current CEO, continues to be optimistic. “A big proportion of the world’s commodities is produced in China. More importantly a lot of commodities are consumed in China,” he said during a media briefing after its first-quarter results were announced late last month. “So there is a lot of room for LME to continue to benefit from that long-term trend. We are well positioned.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/24/466c9670-e346-4456-a71f-e41c9b0e699b_798e21ed.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Because of China’s capital controls, LME has not been able to expand its network of more than 500 authorised warehouses in the country. Without more onshore warehouses, LME’s settlement prices for any of its zinc, copper, aluminium and nickel contracts would be irrelevant for traders in China, the world’s top producer of non-ferrous metals at 64.5 million tons in 2021, observers said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">HKEX has since 2019 launched six base metals mini futures contracts denominated in US dollars that reference LME prices, and the contracts are settled in Hong Kong. These are “mini” as each comprises 5 tons of metals, rather than the 25 tons per contract traded on LME.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But these mini contracts have not drawn in much liquidity. For the first quarter of 2022, these six products traded 90,289 lots, doubling from the same quarter a year ago, but were still far short of the 89.1 million lots traded by the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Trading fees from the exchange contributed HK$280 million to HKEX’s total revenue of HK$4.7 billion (US$598.8 million).</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/08/13/thumbnail_-_clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">08:22</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Former HKEX chief unveils new foreign investment platform to finance Chinese small businesses</p><p>Former HKEX chief unveils new foreign investment platform to finance Chinese small businesses</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">LME also faces competition in China from the country’s own commodities futures exchanges, which are also slowly opening up to foreign investors. The Shanghai International Energy Exchange, a subsidiary of the Shanghai Futures exchange, for instance, already allows foreign investors with an initial margin of not less than 100,000 yuan (US$15,132) or equivalent foreign currency to trade bonded copper futures, crude oil, iron ore, technically specified rubber 20 and low-sulphur fuel oil futures contracts.</p>Changes might be afoot in Guangdong, where HKEX-owned <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Qianhai Mercantile Exchange</span></a> has since October 2018 been offering spot commodities trading. The Hong Kong exchange operator wants to establish yuan spot price benchmarks for various metals as a start, and will establish a mutually recognised warehouse warrant system between LME and Qianhai Mercantile Exchange.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This could form the basis of a “commodity connect”, linking China’s vast commodity markets with LME, HKEX has said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">LME’s nickel rout: does the 145-year metals exchange have a future?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the challenges of overseas expansion, LME is expected to continue enjoying its status as the reference for global metal pricing, industry players said, even as mainland Chinese exchanges are attracting more trading volumes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“With over a hundred years of history, LME has always been the benchmark for physical transactions,” said Arthur Fan, head of Asia-Pacific at commodity-focused financial services firm Marex.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Its settlement prices are hard-wired into many physical trade contracts and this makes it hard to be replaced.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfl66vt8innmaemaOur6%2FEaJirrJmYuaZ7kmpucXFnbnypt8SxZKGnoJqxbq3LnJ%2BepalixLDBy51kra2io3qir9CuoKyhpJ68r3nCnqWtraKuerC4ww%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
