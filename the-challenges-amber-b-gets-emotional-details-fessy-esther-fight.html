The Challenge: Spies, Lies and Allies star Amber Borzotra has been through her fair share of drama during her second season — and it hasn’t been easy.
Soon after joining the season, the season 36 winner, 33, was blindsided by Fessy Shafaat, who she thought she could trust — a betrayal that has been tough for her to move past.

These are people that I want to see go far, these are people that I want to do what I can to help go far in the game,” Amber said on the Thursday, September 16, episode of <a href=#>the “Watch With Us” podcast</a>, referencing the broken <a href=#>Big Brother</a> alliance this season. “It didn’t seem like we were on the same page the previous season. … Going into this season, I wanted to know and I wanted some reassurance.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Challenges-Amber-B-Emotional-Watching-Back.jpg><p>She went on to explain that she was upset by Fessy’s blindside because they had spoken beforehand — and she wanted an apology.</p><p>“I trusted these people more than anyone in the game and I am naive,” the Big Brother alum told Us. “I believe everyone and I trust everyone with their word. … Outside of this game, I check on these people. I make sure they’re good. I want to see them win, too. For me, it was just hard. Even the episodes that have been shown now, it’s kind of difficult seeing things that are being said.”</p><p>During the podcast, Amber couldn’t help but get emotional, noting that she learned a lot after watching her first season and seeing how much people were talking about her behind her back.</p><p>“The Challenge has really taught me a lot about me,” the esthetician said, noting that sometimes she considers not watching back the episodes. “What’s hard for me is I’m 100 percent myself, just like how I would be outside of the game. That’s the hard part for me, being around people that I feel are my friends.”</p><p>She continued through tears, “It’s hard to watch, especially when you see these people as your friends outside of the game. It’s hard because I don’t deal with this in my everyday life. … I really try being a good person, It’s hard to watch and it’s sometimes hard for my parents and my family. They get emotional. I’m like, ‘Mom, Dad, it’s OK!'”</p><p>The Wednesday, September 15, episode ended with Fessy, 29, and Amber getting into a heated discussion that began over pizza and led to Fessy shoving <a href=#><strong>Josh Martinez</strong></a>. Somewhere in the middle, <strong>Esther Agunbiade</strong> got involved — Fessy’s partner who is also in a showmance with Josh — and threw a drink at Amber.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Listen to the full podcast episode</a> for Amber’s reaction to the drink, where they stand now, this season’s showmances and more.</p><p>The Challenge airs on MTV Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmqaeUmK60wNJorpqsk516uLXToWSuq1%2BptaZ5wqGYpaSVo7Smv4yapJudomKvbrPErapmnZ2kwaq7zZqjZpyVqa6quNJmnZ6ro656pr%2FToZyrZZaetKnAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
