He was also a dad to his eldest daughter, <strong>Skylar Staten Randall</strong>, whom he welcomed during a previous relationship.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In March 2022, Sandra announced she was taking a step back from acting to focus on spending time with <a href=#>her family</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I take my job very seriously when I’m at work,” she said at the time. “And I just want to be 24/7 with my babies and my family. That’s where I’m going to be for a while.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Prior to that, Sandra gushed over her relationship with Bryan and <a href=#>the unbreakable bond</a> they shared.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I found the love of my life,” she said during a November 2021 episode of Red Table Talk. “We share two beautiful children — three children, his older daughter. It’s the best thing ever.”</span></p><p><span>The Bird Box actress went on to say that though they had their differences at times, they always set a great example for their kids.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“He’s the example that I would want my children to have. I have a partner who’s very Christian. And so, there’s two very different ways of looking at things. And I don’t always agree with him,” Sandra continued. “He doesn’t always agree with me. But he is an example even when I don’t agree with him that I go, ‘If they can take away from that, and if that is where they feel drawn to, then he’s the exact right parent.’”</span></p><p><span>In the wake of his death, Bryan’s family and loved ones have asked that donations be made to ALS Association and Massachusetts General Hospital.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smKecopZ6o8HLpaaco6NiwKq%2F056pZqugmq6sv4yorK1ln6N6o77YmqVmqpGjsaK4y6xknZ2RqbVw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
