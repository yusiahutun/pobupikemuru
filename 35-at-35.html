Always hang out with people smarter than you. Or is it people like the same pizza toppings as you? No wait‚Äî it‚Äôs people that are up for hanging out that aren‚Äôt trying to friggin judge how smart you are, that‚Äôs it.
 The days are long but the years are short but the hours that make up those days can go fast but each minute is long and then the decades end up feeling really long but when you die you‚Äôll be like ‚Äúthat went fast‚Äù but your resurrection will feel kinda normal speed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Unless you can‚Äôt just take off work any day you friggin feel like it like at some cushy tech job. Like, I dunno, you‚Äôre a single parent trying to keep everything together and you‚Äôd be fired from your job welding bike frames if you told your boss you didn‚Äôt come in because you just need a day to lay around and do nothing. Jimminy crickets.</p></li><li><p>Save your toe wax.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Eliminate all distractions like that mannequin in the attic that looks just like Paula Abdul that is probably staring at you through the ceiling right now.</p></li><li readability=1><p>I care a bunch about some stuff and very little about other stuff. You care different amounts about different stuff. Other people think differently about that stuff. There is a great balance to all this stuff-caring that makes the world both interesting and frustrating.</p></li><li readability=0><p>If I could have any mutant power it would be to twirl my finger in the air and it would make cotton candy that tastes like your mouth.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Only read about half way through dumb lists like this because you obviously get the point by now.</p></li><li readability=4><p>Your health is the most important thing. As your health improves, everything improves. You sleep better. You feel smarter. You feel more comfortable in your own skin. You feel like life is full of possibilities instead of limitations. You get sick less. You‚Äôre more patient. It‚Äôs easier to get a date. That one is weird because it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ do I just look better? Or am I more confident and that‚Äôs more attractive? Or is it because I just have more energy so my head is more in the game at those crucial moments when it matters? It‚Äôs probably all of those things. Plus this good health stuff seems to snowball into more good health. You actually want to make that doctor appointment instead of avoiding it because hey if you can fix that shoulder thing you‚Äôll feel even better than you already do. You wonder what it‚Äôs like to feel like one of those actually skinny people that can like run a 10k no big deal and basically look like they glow. Is it worth trying to get there? Or does the health stuff have diminishing returns? Certainly it means less time writing stupid blog posts, right?</p></li><li readability=0><p>My only regret is not telling that one jerk to go fuck himself man fuck that guy and his wanna be a G bullshit seriously if i could go back in time id start that guys life on fire.</p></li><li readability=1><p>Marry your best friend or the first person that says yes after you beg and whine even though you both kinda know it‚Äôs a bad idea but you know biological clocks and all that good luck im rooting for you.</p></li><li><p>I got a haircut once.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>No kiddin‚Äô ‚Äì cut the hairs right off my head.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Have goals like ‚ÄúI WILL fill this toe wax jar by the end of summer‚Äù</p></li><li readability=0><p>Try not to worry so much unless your churn rate is like 0.8% higher than you‚Äôd like at your dumb startup company or a literal tsunami is coming to destroy your village.</p></li><li readability=10><p>Something something you only live once, religion, money, tv, twitter, something, something, posture, dentist, toe wax, something.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>I‚Äôm done with this stupid list.
