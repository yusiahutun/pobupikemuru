Racism is still a thing and it still goes on in schools. I realised I was very naive because I thought everyone was accepting, but that’s the good thing about the show as it portrays it in a way where you need to see what’s going on.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>She also revealed how she was as a person during her school days and how it is comparable with her character stating,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>I was really, really quiet in school but now I am the exact opposite. I was probably a bit like Nas in school in terms of how quiet she was and then outside she has her other friends. That’s what life was like before she went to Ackley Bridge because Missy didn’t go to the same school as her. I wasn’t that into school, I used to like the creative subjects like Art and English.
