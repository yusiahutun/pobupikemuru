Vallerius admitted he first sold and then began orchestrating online sales of cocaine, methamphetamine, fentanyl, oxycodone and other drugs on a dark website known as the Dream Market.</p>Court documents describe Dream Market as one of the largest criminal sites where anonymous buyers and sellers do transactions using bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Three days before Vallerius was arrested in August 2017, authorities say there were more than 94,000 listings on Dream Market – including some 47,000 illegal drug listings.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/13/7ad68cde-6ec2-11e8-b1d3-9161aa45bf67_972x_125640.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vallerius, who sports a long brownish-red beard, was already under investigation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration when he was detained at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport while en route from Paris to the World Beard and Moustache Championships in Austin, Texas. He had entered the full-beard category.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the hearing, Vallerius admitted he initially began as a Dream Market vendor selling oxycodone and Ritalin using the “OxyMonster” name. Then he was hired to act as an administrator and moderator of Dream Market to facilitate the illegal transactions, according to court documents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Guilty,” Vallerius, who is from the Brittany region of France, said in Hebrew through a court interpreter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Undercover DEA agents made numerous purchases through Dream Market of drugs such as crystal methamphetamine, LSD and hydrocodone. The drugs were shipped via mail to various addresses in the Miami area.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DEA also discovered that Vallerius had Instagram and Twitter accounts. They compared the writing style of “OxyMonster” on the Dream Market forum to the writing style of Vallerius on his social media accounts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Agents discovered many similarities in the use of words and punctuation, including: the word “cheers,” double exclamation marks, frequent use of quotation marks, and intermittent French posts,” court documents say.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Agents were later able to link Vallerius to Dream Market through searches of his laptop computer and other electronic devices seized at the Atlanta airport.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prosecutors and defence lawyers agreed to recommend that US District Judge Robert Scola impose a 20-year prison sentence for Vallerius, but he could get time shaved off through his agreement to cooperate in further investigation of the online drug sales.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition, Vallerius may serve some of his sentence in Great Britain, France or Israel – he is a citizen of all three nations – under an international prisoner transfer programme.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They have to agree,” said defence lawyer Anthony Natale. “At this point we don’t know which specific country.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vallerius mainly spoke to answer the judge’s questions, but added that he was saddened he could not see more of the US because of his felony convictions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is unfortunate … I cannot enjoy this beautiful country and everything it has to offer,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scola is scheduled to sentence Vallerius on September 25.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXy2usitnJ1lo6mutbHSZpqappGZrnCt0a2gnKSVZH9ygY9ua2pnlqeyr6%2FHppinZaWoeqOxwKubZpufo8Gmv9Nmp6WdkZnAbrPUoqOtsV2dsq28yKeeZqqlow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
