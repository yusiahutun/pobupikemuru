Having a warm coat for those cold snowy days will help keep you cozy and dry, no matter what Mother Nature has up her sleeve. Time for a winter coat upgrade? We’ve got you covered with our roundup of the best women’s winter coats for extreme cold — including choices for every style, size, and budget.</p><p>But first, let’s answer a few questions you might have about the best women’s winter coats for extreme cold. (Looking for a plus size coat, or a regular winter coat? We’ve got the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>10 Best Plus Size Women’s Winter Coats for Every Style and Budget</a></strong> and the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>24 Best Winter Coats for Women to Keep Cozy and Stylish in the Cold</a></strong> too!)</p>Read More<h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does a winter coat cost?</h2><p>As we said above, we’ve found coats for every budget — and all of them will keep you warm on even the coldest of days. So, what’s the difference between a coat that costs $100 and one that will run you closer to $1K?</p><p>There are two main factors in how expensive a winter coat for women is — and the first one is whether it’s made to last for a season or for a lifetime. A coat from <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Canada Goose</a></strong>, for example, is an investment that will keep you cozy for many years to come. Excellent craftsmanship and high-quality materials ensure that your winter coat for extreme cold will be your go-to, winter after winter. Less expensive coats may serve you perfectly well for several months, or even years, but are often ready to replace sooner than pricier options.</p><p>Another thing to consider is whether you’re paying more for a brand name. Coats made by <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">The North Face</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Patagonia</a></strong>, for example, often cost a little more than lesser-known brands that you can find on Amazon. That doesn’t always mean they’re better coats, but sometimes you just want to go with a brand you know and trust!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the best winter coat brands?</h2><p>If you’re looking for the best women’s winter coats for extreme cold, brands like <a style=font-weight:700 href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong>Columbia</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong>The North Face</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong>Patagonia</strong></a> are definitely options you’ll want to consider. You’ll also find great choices from <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">L.L. Bean</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Lands’ End</a></strong>.</p><p>You won’t have to sacrifice style or comfort, as most of these coats feature faux fur trims, customizable hoods, and waterproof shells. Brands including <a style=font-weight:700 href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Canada Goose</a> and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Oros</a></strong> have created trendy yet durable coats that are ready to help you tackle even the coldest weather.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the best women’s winter coats for extreme cold weather?</h2><p>If you’re venturing into negative temperatures, you need a coat that’s more than just fashionable. The best women’s winter coats for extreme cold will have down or synthetic down filling to keep you toasty warm, as well as water-repellent and windproof outer-shells to keep out any rain, sleet, harsh winds, and snow. You’ll also want to look for coats with hoods — and bonus points if they have a fur or faux fur trim, as this will provide you even more coverage and warmth!</p><p><strong>Keep scrolling to shop the best women’s winter coats for extreme cold!
