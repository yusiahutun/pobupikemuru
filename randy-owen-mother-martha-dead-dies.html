A note from Alabama's team reveals that the 90-year-old Owen matriarch was surrounded by family in Fort Payne, Ala., when she died. She leaves behind Randy and his two sisters, Reba Patterson and Rachel Carroll, as well as extended family.

As kids, he and his sisters formed the Singing Owen Family Gospel group&nbsp;and performed around Alabama and the south. The group Alabama would be formed in 1969 by Owen and his cousins, Teddy Gentry and Jeff Cook. They'd first crack the Billboard Country Top 40 a decade later with "I Wanna Come Over."</p><p>Martha Owen was preceded in death by her husband, Gladstone&nbsp;Yeuell Owen, who died in 1980 at age 59 of unknown causes. With the release of the band's American Christmas album, Owen spoke about his father and how it haunts him that&nbsp;he never got to see his son's country music success.</p><p>"He's the person who taught me how to play the guitar," <a href=#>Owen wrote</a>. "He could thumb pick like Merle Travis and sing high tenor, harmonizing the way Don Rich would with Buck Owens. If he had lived long enough that I could've taken him to Grand Ole Opry, it would have been amazing."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>In Memoriam: Country Stars Who Have Died in 2022</h2><p>May they rest in peace ...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq5memcZuu9aepWaln6m1pr6MppirrJiWeqWxwJ1knaGVqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
