Try These 7 Fixes</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-02-13</div><p>Finder is the one-stop solution for exploring macOS. It wouldn't be wrong to think of it as the Mac equivalent of File Explorer, the default file management app in Windows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of its many handy tools is the swift search option, which helps you look up all the files on your Mac. But, like apps, Finder too is subject to errors and malfunctions. One of the ways this could manifest is through a faulty search feature, leaving you unable to find anything on your Mac.</p><p>So, how do you fix your Finder search tool? Let's find out.</p><h2 id=restart-your-mac>1. Restart Your Mac</h2><p>You'd be surprised how even a simple restart goes a long way in fixing random errors on your Mac. A reboot clears many processes or apps that otherwise clog your system resources and memory, as well as installs pending updates. It fixes memory leaks or other related issues as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/restart-option-in-macos.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, give <a href=#>your Mac a quick reboot</a> and see if it fixes your Finder issue. To do this, click the <strong>Apple logo</strong> in the menu bar and choose <strong>Restart</strong> from the dropdown.</p><h2 id=relaunch-finder>2. Relaunch Finder</h2><p>Apps stop working all the time for various reasons. So, it's not hard to imagine that something like this might be the case with your Finder search as well. In such cases, relaunching Finder from scratch can solve a lot of your problems.</p><p>Unfortunately, closing the <strong>Finder</strong> window isn't good enough. Instead, you need to click the <strong>Apple logo</strong> in the menu bar and choose <strong>Force Quit</strong> from the dropdown. Now, select <strong>Finder</strong> from the list of apps and click <strong>Relaunch</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/force-quit-app.jpg><p>Your Finder search tool should work properly now. But if it doesn't, move on to the next step.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=check-your-finder-settings>3. Check Your Finder Settings</h2><p>If none of the steps have worked so far, we suggest you check the search settings for the Finder app. Here's how you can do that:</p><li>Launch a Finder window, click <strong>Finder</strong> in the menu bar, and choose <strong>Settings</strong> from the dropdown.</li><li>Head to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab in the new window.</li><li>At the bottom, you'll see the <strong>When performing a search</strong> option. Make sure <strong>Search This Mac</strong> is selected.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/finder-settings.jpg><p>If that's already enabled, and you're still facing issues performing a search in Finder, you may be interested in the next step.</p><h2 id=rebuild-the-search-index>4. Rebuild the Search Index</h2><p>Finder search makes use of the Spotlight search index to look things up. So, if something goes off with the Spotlight index, you may face issues while searching in Finder too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So go through the following steps to rebuild your Spotlight index without any hassle:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/siri-and-spotlight-settings-in-macos.jpg><li>Click the <strong>Apple logo</strong> in the menu bar and select <strong>System Settings</strong> from the dropdown.</li><li>Select <strong>Siri & Spotlight</strong> from the left sidebar.</li><li>Scroll down to the bottom of the right pane and click <strong>Spotlight Privacy</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>plus (+)</strong> button.</li><li>Select <strong>Macintosh HD </strong>using the dropdown at the top of the window that appears. Then, click <strong>Choose</strong>.</li><li>Now, select the drive in the <strong>Spotlight Privacy</strong> window and click the <strong>minus (-)</strong> button.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/privacy-setting-siri-spotlight.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's it. Your search index rebuilding process will begin, and depending on how much data you have, you might have to wait for a few minutes. As soon as the rebuilding is finished, your Finder search should start working once again in no time.</p><h2 id=delete-a-corrupt-finder-plist-file>5. Delete a Corrupt Finder PLIST file</h2><p>If you have a corrupt Finder PLST file on your Mac, the app and its functions may not work as expected. In cases like this, deleting the file, rebooting, and trying your luck from scratch will be the best approach.</p><p>Here's how you can get started:</p><li>Open Finder and press the <strong>Command + Shift + G</strong> keyboard shortcut.</li><li>Head to the following path below:<pre>~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist</pre></li><li>Look for the Finder PLIST file (<strong>com.apple.finder.plist</strong>) from the list, Control-click it, and select <strong>Move to Trash</strong>.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/finder-plist-file.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Your file will be instantly deleted from there. Now, reboot your Mac for the changes to take effect and see if you're able to get the desired search results with Finder.</p><h2 id=boot-your-mac-in-safe-mode>6. Boot Your Mac in Safe Mode</h2><p>You can use safe mode to discover all the troubles or errors that have brought your computer to a halt. So, if none of the above methods have moved the needle for your Mac, performing a Finder search in safe mode is worth a shot.</p><p>However, the steps you need to follow to enter safe mode may vary depending on <a href=#>whether you own an Intel or Apple silicon Mac</a>.</p><h3 id=entering-safe-mode-on-an-intel-mac>Entering Safe Mode on an Intel Mac:</h3><li>Shut down your Mac and wait for 10 seconds.</li><li>Boot up your Mac by pressing the power button and holding the<strong> Shift</strong> key.</li><li>Release the <strong>Shift</strong> key when you see the login window.</li><h3 id=entering-safe-mode-on-an-apple-silicon-mac>Entering Safe Mode on an Apple Silicon Mac:</h3><li>Shut down your Mac and wait for a few seconds.</li><li>Press the power button until you see <strong>Loading startup options</strong> on the screen.</li><li>Select your startup disk.</li><li>Hold the <strong>Shift</strong> key and select <strong>Continue in Safe Mode</strong>.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you've booted into safe mode, launch the Finder search tool and see if you are still facing any problems getting search results. Because safe mode boots up your Mac with only essential apps, you may have to look up and remove the culprit apps if your search tool works as intended now.</p><h2 id=update-your-mac>7. Update Your Mac</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/software-update-section-in-macos.jpg><p>Like any other operating system, macOS is not bulletproof from abrupt bugs. So, carrying out regular updates will help you avoid these issues. macOS updates are crucial for a host of reasons—getting tighter security is a prominent one—but fixing random errors in apps and other system software probably tops the list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, <a href=#>update your Mac</a> by heading to <strong>System Settings > General > Software Update</strong> and then try searching in Finder again.</p><h2 id=search-in-finder-without-issues>Search in Finder Without Issues</h2><p>The methods we listed above can help you resolve the issues you're facing with Finder search on your Mac. So, take your time and try them out individually.</p><p>However, if none of these troubleshooting steps worked in your favor, you may need to take your Mac to a nearby Apple Store for in-person hardware assistance. Factory resetting your Mac may also help, but make sure you only perform that if you're out of options as it will wipe all the data on your computer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGidoqaUmr9uv8SaqZygXaO8tXnWqKmkoZ6ceq6twmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
