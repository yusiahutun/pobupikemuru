If you’re normally a fan of springing forward, then you’ll be delighted as ever to learn more about <a href=#>how the new moon in Aries of March 2023 will affect each zodiac sign</a>. After all, in addition to a collective rebirth occurring after a long period of darkness, we are also preparing to welcome in the astrological new year. This year’s Spring Equinox is happening on March 20 at exactly 5:24 p.m. ET, which marks the first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as <a href=# id=auto-tag_aries data-tag=aries>Aries</a> season.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newmoonintauruszodiac.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"><p>A symbol of fertility and new beginnings, there is an undeniable sense of revival that energizes and inspires us during this cardinal fire season, as it is equivalent to the first spark of life after a cold and dark winter. I know what you’re thinking: how does this relate to the <a href=# id=auto-tag_new-moon data-tag=new-moon>new moon</a>? Well, <a href=#>the new moon in Aries</a> will take place less than 24 hours after the Equinox—March 21 at 1:23 p.m. ET, to be exact—which makes the energy all the more fertile, auspicious and celestially potent!</p><p>It gets even better though, as the moon will be renewing itself via *zero* degrees of this cardinal fire sign, which is considered to be a critical degree point in <a href=# id=auto-tag_astrology data-tag=astrology>astrology</a>. Put it this way—we’re not only initiating a brand-new season, lunar phase and astrological year, but also via the earliest and most primal degree of the first sign in the zodiac. Not setting intentions during this lunation would be similar to <a href=#>the iconic scene in Pretty Woman</a> when she walks into the clothing store in Rodeo Drive. “Big mistake. Huge!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/newmooninvirgohoroscopes.png><p>This is an Equinox portal, but not just any portal. With two <a href=#>generational planets changing signs during March</a>—Saturn and Pluto—it’s safe to say, this new beginning will be like no other. It’s not just a new adventure, but also an identity birthing true from within. For reference, think back to 2008 <a href=#>when Pluto first entered Capricorn</a>, as it will soon conclude its journey through this cardinal earth sign, and debut in Aquarius on March 24. Wherever Capricorn lives in your birth chart is where you’ve deeply regenerated and transformed, so while you may not know exactly what’s to come of this shift, you can almost sense the echoing of your inner calling coming from the depths of your soul.</p><p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The new moon in Aries takes place on <span>March 21 at 1:23 a.m. ET</span>.</p></figure></p><p>It’s important to also consider the ruler of this lunation, which in this case is Mars. A representation of our thought process, communication style and immediate circles, <a href=#>Mars in Gemini</a> continues to highlight the duality of your sacred masculine and divine feminine energies. When looking back at the beginning of this transit—which started back in October 2022—what have you mastered in this area of life? Has this healed or activated your throat chakra? Have you confronted the shadow side of your self-dialogue and mental processes?</p><p>On a brighter note, <a href=#>Venus—planet of love, relationships, pleasure and values</a>—will be transiting through its sign of rulership, Taurus, and in conjunction with the North Node of Fate. This speaks to a newly found sense of comfort and self-reliance that could be making itself known during this new moon. In harmony with Saturn, we are also being divinely guided and supported on this new journey of self-mastery.</p><p>If your <a href=#>sun sign</a>, <a href=#>moon sign</a> or <a href=#>rising sign</a> falls under any of the following <a href=# id=auto-tag_zodiac-signs data-tag=zodiac-signs>zodiac signs</a>, the upcoming new moon will rock your world. Here’s why:</p><h2 class=hide-small><strong>How The New Moon Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ARIES4.jpg><p><span>Make a wish, Aries! This new moon is equally as vibrant as it is auspicious for you, and it’s happening in your cardinal territory. Sounds cliche, but this is where the cosmos is reminding you to dream big, as the sun and moon will become one in your name, as you embark on this brand-new journey around through the zodiac. Mars in Gemini continues to bring emphasis and momentum to your communication sector and immediate surroundings, but as Pluto wraps up in Capricorn and the highest point in your chart, you are reminded to affirm your strength and new-found sense of authority.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TAURUS4.jpg><p><span>Make peace with the identity you’re leaving behind, Taurus. The sun and moon will join forces in warrior-like Aries via your 12th house of closure, dreams, inhibitions and all things behind the scenes, which has everything to do with surrender and healing. Keep in mind, in addition to Mars igniting your stability-seeking second house of comfort, finances and value systems—since October 2022—your celestial ruler, Venus, is now transiting through your sign and forming a productive sextile to taskmaster Saturn. Whether it be a financial responsibility or an identity that made you feel secure once upon a time, it’s time to let go and start again.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GEMINI4.jpg><p><span>You’re breaking free of attachments that no longer resonate with your future goals and dreams, Gemini. This is especially true when considering the end of Pluto’s 15-year-journey through Capricorn and your eighth house of joint ventures on March 24, but back to the new moon! It will renew itself via your 11th house of associations, community and individual freedom, and amidst Mars’ journey through your sign. You’re in your main-character energy, but you’re also reflecting on the duality of your connections and friendships. Also, with Venus sitting alongside the North Node in Taurus, you’re being encouraged to prioritize your values and loyalty.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CANCER4.jpg><p><span>You’re finding yourself all over again, and taking the lead, Cancer. After all, it’s been 15 years of Pluto in Capricorn not to mention via your committed seventh house of agreements. However, with the moon renewing itself in Aries via your 10th house of authority and reputation in the world, there is fertility and momentum when in regards to your career ventures, and public persona. With Mars in Gemini igniting your 12th house of unconscious patterns, however, you could be in two minds about next steps. Lean on Venus conjunct the North Node in Taurus, as you gave a community of individuals supporting your goals and dreams.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LEO4.jpg><p><span>Your future is bright, and you can feel it in your bones, Aries. Renewing itself in your sister fire-sign, via your expansive ninth house of adventure, wisdom and unknown territory, this new moon is bringing you inspiration and momentum. And with its ruler, Mars, transiting through your 11th house of future visions and community affairs (since October 2022), you’re likely seeing the duality of your beliefs, specifically when in regards to your friendships and ideals. The best part? With Venus and the North Node lighting up your 10th house of authority, you are equally as supported as you are confident with the idea of moving forward.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/virgo4.jpg><p><span>Your approach towards intimacy and joint ventures is under the spotlight of this lunation, Virgo. Keep in mind, it’s important to also consider all that’s transpired in your fifth house of love, passion and pleasure since Pluto first entered Capricorn back in 2008. What’s transformed for you when in regards to your heart’s desires, self-expression and love language? With Mars (ruler of this lunation) soon to conclude its journey through Gemini and your 10th house of authority, there is greater emphasis on the duality of your ventures and who you assert yourself in your relationships. Venus conjunct the North Node in Taurus, however, highlights the stability and value of your accolades.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LIBRA4.jpg><p><span>Do you and your significant other(s) share similar belief systems, Libra? With the moon renewing itself in your polar opposite sign, Aries, there is revival and fertility surrounding your committed seventh house of agreements, compromise and other people. Everything from the way you approach others, to whether or not you feel confident in your expression is under review at this time. Moreover, with the ruler of this lunation (Mars) transiting through Gemini and your ninth house of self-discovery and higher learning, you are being encouraged to consider the duality of your philosophies. Fortunately, thanks to your celestial ruler, Venus, sitting alongside the North Node, you have the support and stability needed to build a solid connection moving forward.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SCORPIO4.jpg><p><span>New project in the works, Scorpio? If you’re not taking the lead when it comes to your day-to-day routine, you could be integrating a new health regimen into your world. Either way, the moon will renew itself via your responsible sixth house of due diligence, and all while its ruler (Mars) ignites your eighth house of intimate unions and shared resources. Given that Mars also happens to be your traditional planetary ruler, it’s important to reflect on everything you’ve learned since October 2022, which is when it first began to retrograde through Gemini. What did you discover about your everyday life, specifically when in regards to giving and receiving. It’s time to take your power back.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SAG4.jpg><p><span>Your heart wants what it wants—it’s as simple as that, Sagittarius. The moon will renew itself in Aries—via your fifth house of love, passion, authenticity and self-expression—and all while its ruler (Mars) begins to wrap up its journey through Gemini, and your seventh house of agreements, compromise and significant others. On that note, reflect on what you’ve learned about your significant others, as well as the duality of your one-on-one connections. You’re not only stepping into a brand-new identity, but also recognizing the mental blockages that may have stifled your relationships once upon a time. Pluto is also about to wrap up in Capricorn, so it’s also important to reflect on what’s transformed and regenerated, whether financially or in terms of your values.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CAP4.jpg><p><span>Home is where your heart is, and this is especially true under this new moon, Capricorn. For instance, the sun and moon will be joining forces at zero degrees of Aries, bringing emphasis and fertility to your fourth house of home, family matters and emotional foundations, but there’s more. Mars in Gemini—the ruler of this new moon—continues to ignite your sixth house of health, daily rituals and due diligence, highlighting everything from the logistics surrounding your family dynamic to your thought process/self-dialogue on a personal level. Fortunately, with Venus conjunct the North Node in Taurus, there is a new-found sense of confidence and stability in your expression.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AQUA4.jpg><p><span>Your truth will always set you free, Aquarius. This is especially significant to consider with the moon renewing itself via zero degrees of warrior-like Aries, and via your third house of communication, thought process and immediate surroundings. Keep in mind, the ruler of this new moon (Mars) has been transiting through your fifth house of authenticity, love language and self-expression since October, highlighting everything from your perspective on love and romance, to the duality of your heart’s desires. Pluto is also days away from making its debut in your sign, which means there’s a new identity and energetic aesthetic being birthed from within you.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PISCES4.jpg><p><span>Your values are worth fighting for, Pisces. After all, what are the odds that the ruler of this new moon (Mars) has been transiting through your fourth house of home, family and emotional foundations since October 2022? While the moon renews itself in Aries and your stability-seeking second house of comfort, finances and value systems, you are being encouraged to consider everything you’ve learned since last fall. What parts of your upbringing and/or family dynamics do you wish to continue nourishing, and cultivating? What do you genuinely long for in a home, and are you willing to have these conversations with your loved ones?</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MANIFEST-ISSUE-email-sig.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9mom6KZk2R%2BdICRbG5wZ5ikxG66xLBkpqefo3q4tculZJqelpqwtXnEmpqhZaqksaqtwmaqop%2BeZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
