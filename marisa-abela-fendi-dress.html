"I wanted this dress to reflect Marisa's strength, elegance and grace," Croysdill told us. "Her grace is unmatched. We also wanted to celebrate the essence of Amy and the smouldering smokey world of jazz and all its timelessness."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, see what Abela had to say about the dress, her relationship with fashion and how she slips into character for the red carpet.</p><img alt="marisa abela" title="marisa abela" width=2190 height=3285 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-04-08-marisaabela-240-rt-66155b7d82a66.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Josh Shinner</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Inside my beauty bag: Marisa Abela" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-imbb-ma-1-66151ad720b6b.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Please talk us through your look – what drew you to this particular outfit?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I am wearing a custom Fendi dress. My stylist Aimee and I wanted to go for something really elegant – it is such a big moment, so we kind of wanted to keep the dress simple. We have been doing a lot of black on the tour, and so we’ve gone for dark brown for a little point of difference, and then I am wearing the Cartier Panthere rings, which is an homage to the lioness necklace that Amy used to wear."</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What makes Fendi such a great fit for you and your personal style?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I just feel really comfortable in Fendi, especially when they create something custom for me – it is just always perfect for my body. The way they tailor clothes to you and really accentuate a woman’s figure just really appeals to me. A lot of Italian brands are so good at that– really making the most of a woman’s body and not shying away from it."</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">How involved do you tend to be with the styling process?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I am pretty involved – I find it really fun, but I also have an amazing team and we always talk through everything. This process has been months long, and so we are talking to each other every day about what is going to work. I’ve been working with my hair stylist Anastasia (Stylianou), my make-up artist Neil (Young), and then Michelle (Class) – who does my nails – and of course Aimee this whole time, and so we’ve been speaking about the details for weeks, what we’re going to do with the hair, what we're going to do with the make-up. If the dress is more extravagant, then we’ll do less with the hair – and then tonight, because the jewellery is more extravagant, we will go more fresh and youthful with the make-up. It’s exciting. It’s an exciting process."</p><img alt="marisa abela" title="marisa abela" width=2075 height=3112 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-04-08-marisaabela-295-rt-66155b7d1653d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Josh Shinner</span></p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What kind of fashion makes you feel your most confident?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Just being comfortable. I never want to feel like I'm putting myself out there so much to the point where, if something is wrong, it’s going to be a problem for me. It’s much more about feeling comfortable and myself – and then I do feel sexy and powerful because I am not worried about what I look like.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It’s also really about trusting your team and what you’ve created with them. They are all in creative control of this too, so I never feel like I am stepping out and putting myself forward, I am actually almost playing a character. When you look at it like that, you lose that sense of self-consciousness and vanity because it’s not really about you, it’s more about the look."</p><img alt="a black and white photo of a dress in a doorway" title="a black and white photo of a dress in a doorway" width=1840 height=2760 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-04-08-marisaabela-082-rt-66169d1d613fc.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Josh Shinner</span></p><img alt="a person lying on a bed" title="a person lying on a bed" width=2240 height=3360 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-04-08-marisaabela-095-rt-copy-66169d6e34f1b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Josh Shinner</span></p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">How has your style evolved over the years?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think because I spend so much time like in other people's clothes – whether that is on set as an actor or during press – I am often being dressed as someone else, so when I dress as me, it's just all about feeling cool and comfortable. If I don't try particularly hard in my day-to-day outfits. But, definitely, as I’ve gotten older, I have a few select brands I like and I really try to buy pieces that will stand the test of time, rather than just manic shopping."</p><img alt="marisa abela" title="marisa abela" width=2240 height=3360 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-04-08-marisaabela-478-rt-66155b7c6f59d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Josh Shinner</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What has been your most memorable fashion moment in recent years and why?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I mean, tonight will definitely be one of them. But actually, I enjoy that this isn’t really about one particular moment, it’s a culmination of everything coming together. I just did my first ever television interview (with Jonathan Ross) and I wore a Chanel suit that made me feel really powerful but feminine. I really enjoyed doing that – but then a couple of days later, I wore a Gucci bomber for a radio interview, and I like the difference in each occasion and what I am wearing. It’s never one thing individually, it’s about the whole picture."</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What is your ideal getting-ready set-up?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think it's so important to surround yourself with people that are fun, and are enjoying the moment as much as you. Of course, it’s important to look and feel your best but I really do believe that there is something about beauty coming from the inside. There is a happiness and aura of confidence that you can radiate and I think looking great is all about owning a moment and feeling powerful. To do that, I think the space around you needs to be exciting and happy."</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">When do you feel most beautiful?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Being on the red carpet, that still doesn’t really feel like me. Honestly, the time I feel most beautiful is probably when I am on holiday wearing a little sundress, just with my boyfriend. That is probably when I feel the most confident."</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Fashion has a reputation for being frivolous, but why does what we wear matter?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It just does matter to feel good about yourself and to have confidence. If clothes don’t do that for you, then that’s OK, but for me, they can really help bring that out of me, and they also can help speak for you without you even having to open your mouth."</p><img alt="marisa abela" title="marisa abela" width=2194 height=3291 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-04-08-marisaabela-441-rt-66155b7a4d3cf.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Josh Shinner</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The making of Marisa Abela's Fendi couture gown" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-04-08-marisaabela-240-rt-66155b7d82a66.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG9nbWtpZX90e8yaqaKrkWKuo7HLmmSfnZ6Ztm6w0Z6qrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
