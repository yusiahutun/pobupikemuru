Kim made her TV debut in 2003 as Paris Hilton’s best friend on The Simple Life, but it wasn’t until four years later, when E! premiered her family’s reality TV show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, that she became the household name we know today.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> premiered in October 2007 and ran for 20 seasons before its <a href=# rel=noopener>end in 2021</a>. The show, which was created by Ryan Seacrest, starred Kim, her mom <a href=# rel=noopener>Kris Jenner</a>, her stepfather Caitlyn Jenner and her five siblings, <a href=# rel=noopener>Kourtney Kardashian</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Khloé Kardashian</a>, Rob Kardashian, <a href=# rel=noopener>Kendall Jenner</a> and Kylie Jenner. The show also led to several spinoffs for Kim, including Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Dash Dolls. After Kim announced the end of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, news broke that the Kardashian-Jenner family had <a href=# rel=noopener>signed a deal with Hulu</a> to create content for the streaming service after the series finale of their E! reality TV show.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>However, as fans know, reality TV isn’t the only way Kim makes her money. In 2017, Kim launched beauty brands, <a href=# rel=noopener>KKW Beauty and KKW Fragrance.</a> She followed the businesses with her shapewear brand, <a href=# rel=noopener>Skims</a>, in 2019. Along with her beauty and TV careers, <a href=# id=auto-tag_kim-kardashian data-tag=kim-kardashian>Kim Kardashian</a>‘s <a href=# id=auto-tag_net-worth data-tag=net-worth>net worth</a> also includes the money she makes from her 2014 mobile game, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, which she released in 2014. In 2015, she also published a photo book of selfies titled Selfish. She’s also had small roles in films like 2008’s Disaster Movie, 2009’s Deep in the Valley and 2013’s Temptation: Confession of a Marriage Counselor. And, of course, Kim Kardashian’s net worth also accounts for her <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram sponsorships,</a> which are reported to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars (sometimes millions) per post. So that’s Kim’s career in a nutshell. Read on for how much she makes from her various businesses, as well as what Kim Kardashian’s net worth is now.</p><h2>How much did Kim Kardashian make from Keeping Up With the Kardashians?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Keeping-Up-With-the-Kardashians.jpg><p>In 2017, TMZ reported that the Kardashians signed a <a href=# rel=noopener>$150 million deal</a> with E! for five seasons of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. After manager Kris’ 10 percent cut for negotiating the deal, the sum would leave $135 million (or $27 million) to split between the show’s six main leads: Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall, Kylie and Kris. In an interview on The Ellen Degeneres Show in 2017, Kris confirmed that money from Keeping Up With the Kardashians is split evenly between everyone, which means that each sister and Kris would receive $4.5 million each season. However, given that Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Kris all have executive producer credits on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, they stand to make a bit more than Kendall and Kylie. The exact number that the Kardashian sisters and Kris make is unknown. Keeping Up With the Kardashians aired its series finale in 2021 after 20 seasons.</p><h2>How much does Kim Kardashian make from The Kardashians?</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/the-kardashians-hulu.png></p><p>Kim and her family’s second reality TV show, The Kardashians, aired on Hulu in 2021.&nbsp;In December 2020, OK! reported that Kim and the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner family <a href=# rel=noopener>deal with Hulu</a> was more than what they made with E!. “Officially the Kardashian-Jenner family will be developing global content. But Kim, Kourtney, Khloé, Kris, Kendall, and Kylie will also be involved with marketing and getting buzz for the network, and getting paid a fortune for it,” a source told the magazine at the time.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> reported in 2022 that the Kardashian-Jenners were paid at nine figures—or at least $100 million—for two seasons and 40 episodes of The Kardashians. “Well, money always matters,” Kris told Variety at the time about why the family decided to move from E! to Hulu. “I think that anybody would be foolish to say that money doesn’t matter anymore.”</p><p>Kim makes between $7.5 million to $8.3 million per season on The Kardashians.&nbsp;Kim’s salary is a sixth of the $100 million Hulu paid the Kardashian-Jenners for The Kardashians, which was divided evenly among the five Kardashian-Jenners—Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, Kendall and Kylie—and their mother, Kris. It’s unclear, however, if Kris took a 10 percent cut of her daughters Kardashians salaries as their manager. If Kris took a cut, Kim made around $15 million for two seasons (or $7.5 million per season) of The Kardashians.

However, according to TMZ’s sources, those numbers are on the low end of what Kim earns. The source claimed that Kim actually earns $1 million per Instagram post. In an interview on My Guest Needs No Introduction in 2020, Kim explained that she makes more money on Instagram than on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, which is why she was OK with the show ending.</p><p>“We would not be who we are today without Keeping Up With the Kardashians and that’s why we continue to share our lives,” she said at the time. “Even if, realistically, we can post something on social media and make more than we do a whole season.”</p><h2>How much did Kim Kardashian make from KKW Beauty?</h2><p>It’s unclear how much Kim makes from her beauty brands, KKW Beauty and KKW Fragrance, but according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>, those two businesses make the bulk of Kim Kardashian’s net worth. In 2020, Kim sold 20 percent of KKW Beauty and KKW Fragrance to Coty (a beauty company that owns brands like Balenciaga and Clairol) for $200 million. Forbes reports that Kim’s other main business, Skims, raised $5 million from VC firm Imaginary Ventures in 2019.</p><h2>What is Kim Kardashian’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/kim-kardashian-vanity-fair-oscars-party.jpg><p>The question everyone wants to know: What is Kim Kardashian’s net worth?
