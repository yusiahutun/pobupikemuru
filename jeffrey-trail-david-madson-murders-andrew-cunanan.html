Since the three people involved in the Trail and Madson crimes are dead, ACS resorted to crafting a narrative around exactly what happened during and between the murders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here, we're laying out the facts, so you can separate them from American Crime Story's fiction.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Jeffrey Trail</h2><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Before Trail's murder</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Andrew Cunanan and Jeff Trail were very good friends—Cunanan would describe Trail as "my brother," <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1997/09/cunanan199709 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to Maureen Orth at Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">according to Maureen Orth at Vanity Fair</a>. But a rift had formed between the two, and Trail's friend Michael Williams told Vanity Fair Trail "never wished to see [Cunanan] again.” Trail told Williams Cunanan was involved with selling drugs and wanted Trail to join him, but Trail refused.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Trail had moved to Minneapolis for a job a few months before the murders, and Cunanan's ex, David Madson, also lived there. Cunanan still resided in San Diego at the time, and before he left for his trip to Minneapolis, he reportedly told friends he had "unfinished business" with Trail. According to Orth's book about the Cunanan murder spree, <a data-external=true href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/044022585X data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vulgar Favors" data-vars-ga-product-id=99b7b0b7-bbcc-48d3-939a-a916f762d45e data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/044022585X data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/044022585X data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/044022585X data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand=Dell data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=eea88d60-1383-4538-ac04-3bb18b370afb data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Dell data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="United States" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Vulgar Favors</a>, Cunanan often showed up in Minneapolis unannounced to visit Trail and Madson.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Madson picked up Cunanan from the Minneapolis airport when he arrived from San Diego on Friday, April 25, and they had dinner with Madson's friends. According to friends of Madson who spoke to <span class=redactor-unlink>Vanity Fair</span>, Madson was uneasy during the meal. The next day, Saturday, Cunanan apparently stayed at Trail's apartment without Trail, who went out of town but left a key for Cunanan under the doormat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On Sunday, Cunanan presumably returned to Madson's apartment. He left a message for Trail at 8 PM stating he'd "like to see" Trail.</p><img alt="Eyewear, Conversation, Photography, White-collar worker, " title="Eyewear, Conversation, Photography, White-collar worker, " width=1500 height=750 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/acsversace-ep305-scday-ray-0189-1518636491.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FX</span><p>Finn Wittrock as Jeff Trail and Darren Criss as Andrew Cunanan in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The first kill</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At 9:45 PM Sunday, April 27, Trail entered Madson's apartment. According to Vanity Fair, a neighbor heard someone yell, "Get the fuck out," the sounds of someone striking a wall, and then running water.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Vulgar Favors, Trail's head, face, and upper torso sustained 27 blows from a claw hammer. His watch had stopped at 9:55 PM.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The Trail murder scene</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On Tuesday, two of Madson's colleagues went to his apartment after he failed to show at work two days in a row, <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1997/09/cunanan199709 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair reports" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vanity Fair reports</a>. They heard noises in the apartment—one colleague said she thought people were whispering—and called the police, who said they would have to break down the door and shoot Madson's dog, Prints, if he became aggressive. Instead of risking that, Madson's co-workers called his superintendent to open the door. She discovered the apartment empty—save for Trail's body wrapped in a carpet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,138062,00.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to TIME" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">According to TIME</a>, Madson's apartment was rife with evidence, including the murder weapon, though Orth reports in Vulgar Favors that investigators bungled the recovery of other important evidence. For example, investigators found a gym bag containing drugs, porn, and bullets (the exact kind later found in Madson's body) but couldn't determine whether the bag belonged to Madson or Cunanan—until a friend of Madson's pointed out that Cunanan's name was written on the bag. Vanity Fair also reports that authorities found Cunanan's toiletry bag and a pair of bloody size 36 jeans (likely Cunanan's, as Madson wore a 32) in Madson's apartment in June—two months after the first two murders.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The initial investigation</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On Wednesday morning, authorities identified the body as Trail's thanks to the tattoo on his left leg. Immediately, they suspected Madson, still missing. “It’s his apartment. There’s a body in there. There’s no way to pin it on Cunanan as opposed to Madson," Minneapolis police sergeant Robert Tichich told Vanity Fair.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">David Madson</h2><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">After Trail's murder</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Authorities don't really know what Cunanan and Madson did between Trail's death and Madson's murder, or what exactly Cunanan did after killing Madson. They're not even sure exactly when or where Madson died.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On Monday, April 28, the day after Trail's murder, the <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/19/us/first-killing-may-offer-clues-to-four-others.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">New York Times</a> reports Madson's neighbors saw him and Cunanan walking Madson's dog, Prints. Between the Tuesday and Friday after Trail's death, someone reported seeing Madson's red Jeep Cherokee driving north on Interstate 35, according to Vanity Fair, but the witness did not see the driver's face. A restaurant owner reported seeing Cunanan and Madson eating together, but Orth's investigation in Vuglar Favors proved that account false.</p><img alt="Conversation, Interaction, Sitting, White-collar worker, Luxury vehicle, Table, Gesture, Furniture, Businessperson, Vacation, " title="Conversation, Interaction, Sitting, White-collar worker, Luxury vehicle, Table, Gesture, Furniture, Businessperson, Vacation, " width=1500 height=750 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/acs-204-082217-0120-r-1518636644.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FX</span><p>Cody Fern as David Madson and Darren Criss as Andrew Cunanan in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What we do know is Madson's red Jeep was parked at a Chicago parking garage from 6 AM to 7 PM on Wednesday, April 30—one day after Trail's body was discovered and three days before Madson's would be found 450 miles away. It's unclear whether Madson and Cunanan were together in Chicago on Wednesday, or if Cunanan killed Madson and left his body on the shore of Rush Lake before he arrived in Chicago. The latter seems to be the most likely case. Even though Madson's time of death was originally recorded as Friday, May 2, Orth lays out evidence in Vulgar Favors that suggests he died earlier than that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Madson's family <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/19/us/first-killing-may-offer-clues-to-four-others.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told the New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">told the New York Times</a> they believe Madson "walked in" on the murder, and Cunanan took him hostage as a result.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Madson's murder scene</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fishermen found Madson's body, riddled with Golden Saber .40-cal. bullets, on Saturday morning.
