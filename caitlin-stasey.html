Caitlin then joined Star of the Sea College to further her education but later dropped out of the College to continue her acting career. Nonetheless, she continued to consider a training program related to her field of study.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Age_And_Body_Measurements></span><strong>Age And Body Measurements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Caitlin, who was born in May 1990, is 31 years old as of May 2021.

The creators claimed that her character would not be killed off, allowing Stasey to return.</li><li>In 2008, Stasey was cast as the primary character Ellie Linton in the film adaptation of the YA novel Tomorrow, When the War Began, as a young girl who documents her time with friends fighting the invasion of Australia.</li><li>Caitlin Stasey also sang a harmony duet with Neighbors castmate <strong>Dean Geyer</strong> at the Erinsborough High School Formal.

The two would always hang out together after their pack-up and would frequently enter the shoot set hand in hand.</p><p>But unfortunately, their romance could not survive the test of time, and they ended up splitting in the latter half of <strong>2009</strong> after dating for two years.</p><p>Post her break up with Clark, the actress moved on and dated another of her Neighbours co-star, <strong>Jonathan Patrick Moore</strong>, previously known as <strong>Jonathan Wood</strong>. The couple apparently dated for 2-3 months in the first half of 2009 and parted ways.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Emily Browning Bio, Age, Height, Career, Relationships, Net Worth, Social Media Presence >></a></strong></h4><p>Then in the second half of 2009, Caitlin was linked with South African – Australian singer Dean Geyer. As surprising as it may sound, just like her previous partners, even Dean was one of the cast members of the show Neighbours. However, the couple never publically acclaimed their relationship, and the reasons and year of their breakup are still unknown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvstarsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/stasey-079.jpg><p>Then, in 2014, her future husband, <strong>Lucas Neff,</strong> an American actor, entered her life. The pair met on the set of their film, Fear.Inc., and began dating shortly after. After nearly two years of dating, the couple married in 2016. However, there were strong speculations in 2020 that the pair had called it quits, although official confirmation is still awaiting.</p><p>Also, in 2015, Caitlin came out as a bisexual, and in an interview, she stated, &nbsp;“I know it troubles people for me to refer to myself as a lesbian considering I have a male partner. I’ve known I was mostly gay ever since I can remember… I’m happier being fluid. I’m happier being honest.”</p><p>And Caitlin also referred to herself as pansexual.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth_How_Much_Does_Caitlin_Stasey_Earns></span><strong>Net Worth| How Much Does Caitlin Stasey Earns?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Caitlin started her acting career at an early age; also, she has worked as a singer. The actress began her unstoppable career with TV series before moving on to do several amazing films.</p><p>Caitlin has been in the entertainment industry for nearly 19 years, and her net worth is believed to be over <strong>$3 million</strong> throughout her career.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Martin Bashir fraud techniques to get Princess Diana’s famous interview in 1995. >></a></strong></h4><p>The majority of her films have been extremely profitable and have played an important role in building her name in the business. Not only movies and shows, but the actress has also been a part of great brand endorsements and sponsorships.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Social_Media_Presence></span><strong>Social Media Presence</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Celebrities must stay current to maintain a strong relationship and engagement with their fans and boost their name, which is why they utilize social media. Caitlin, like everyone else, is active on social media.</p><p>In fact, many high-end brands would not sign actors as brand ambassadors if they do not have a social media presence with a high number of followers. So, indeed, it has become an essential part, particularly in the life of an actor.</p><p>Caitlin supposedly has a profile on only one social media platform, and that is Instagram. The actress is quite active on Instagram and is often seen sharing pictures of her photoshoots, vacations, and random images. Let’s have a look at the number of followers that this diva has.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> – 232k followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqjBor7SoqWfp16YvK57wpqgraSZo3q0wMCsnLJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
