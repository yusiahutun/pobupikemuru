Similar to the Avalon’s legendary charm, Lakshadweep islands are known for its beautiful and isolated coral atolls. It also features stunning lagoons that disguise many bio-diverse mysteries beneath their surface. In Lakshadweep, cultural treasures and vibrant marine life create a unique attraction, making it a real-world counterpart to the legendary Avalon. It’s a place where time seems to stand still, and the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur. This article makes that boundary a bit clear and defines everything you need to know about <a href=# rel=noopener>Lakshadweep islands</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>History of Lakshadweep</h2><p>The earliest record of Lakshadweep Islands was when a Greek sailor first mentioned the islands of Lakshadweep in the 1st century CE as a source of tortoise shells.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/History-of-Lakshadweep.jpg><p>These points broadly summarize the history of Lakshadweep Islands. However there are many more such tales that define the mystique of this place.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Economy of Lakshadweep Islands</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Economy-of-Lakshadweep-Islands.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Eco-System at Lakshadweep</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. <strong>Land and Climate:</strong></h3><p>Lakshadweep consists of small islands, without exceeding the width of 1 mile. The Amindivis are the northmost, and Minicoy is the southmost. Inhabited islands are mostly coral atolls, with higher eastern sides suitable for living and lagoons on the west protecting from monsoons. The sandy soils are coral-derived. Temperatures range from about 70 °F to nearly 90 °F throughout the year. Cyclones rarely make landfall on the Arabian Sea islands, but their associated winds and waves can alter the topography.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Plant and Animal Life:</h3><p>Lakshadweep Islands teems with coconut palms and diverse trees, including banyans, casuarinas, pandani (screw pines), breadfruits, tamarinds, and tropical almonds. Betel nuts and betel leaves thrive here. In the surrounding waters, sharks, bonitos, tunas, snappers, and flying fish are prominent, while manta rays, octopuses, crabs, turtles, and various gastropods abound. The islands also host a variety of water birds like herons, teals, and gulls.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. People and Faith:</h3><p>People in Lakshadweep, except on Minicoy, trace their roots to migrants from the Malabar Coast in southwest India, arriving before the 7th century CE. These migrants, later converting to Islam, established the predominant religion in Lakshadweep. While Islam is the main faith, remnants of the original Hindu migrants’ religious and social practices persist, as seen in matrilineal kinship and caste-like groups. Malayalam is the primary language, with Mahi spoken on Minicoy and some Hindi speakers. The population is concentrated on Andrott, Kavaratti, Minicoy, and Amini islands.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What, Where, and Why Lakshadweep Islands?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1.1-What-Where-and-Why-Lakshadweep-Islands.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. What and where is Lakshadweep?</h3><p>Located 500 km southwest of Kochi, the 4200 sq km lagoon land of Lakshadweep comprises 36 islands, of which only ten are inhabited, covering a total landmass of 32 sqm. Despite its political and historical connection to India, it remains somewhat isolated from mainland developments. The islands faced challenges due to the delayed communication of Gandhi’s assassination, which took 14 days to reach them. Primarily dependent on imports, from tissue paper to vegetables and electricity, everything comes from the Indian mainland, as the islands lack power plants for electricity generation.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Why visit Lakshadweep?</h3><p>Just 10m from the shore, dive into turquoise waters to discover vibrant coral and Nemo (yes, the Clownfish). The islands, surrounded by coconut groves, offer constant sea views as you drive. With a small population of 66,000, it feels like there are more coconut trees than people. Lakshadweep’s regulated tourism preserves its marine and land ecosystems, creating an eco-friendly haven. For an affordable beach getaway with India’s cleanest shores, <a href=# rel=noopener>head to the less-explored Lakshadweep</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3.

Once on the islands, walking is sufficient, as they are easily navigable. Boats are the primary mode of transport, and while there’s a chopper service, it’s pricier for island hopping.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best Things to do in Lakshadweep: A Group of 36 Islands</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1.2-Best-Things-to-do-in-Lakshadweep_-A-Group-of-36-Islands-source-Memories-and-Such.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1.
