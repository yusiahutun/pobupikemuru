While performing his new single, "Boy," Brice was taken aback in the best possible way when his two young sons, 9-year-old Takoda Brice-Reeveley and 4-year-old&nbsp;Ryker Mobley Brice, ran up onstage to embrace&nbsp;him.</p><p>The date marked the four-year anniversary for Brice and his wife&nbsp;Sara Reeveley, who was also at the show and planned the sneak attack&nbsp;on her husband. Dumfounded at first, the excitement of the situation overcomes&nbsp;the country singer in a sweet clip from the show&nbsp;as he kneels down to&nbsp;hug his children, beaming with joy. Brice revealed to his&nbsp;the crowd that it was his&nbsp;anniversary with his wife and that his children's appearance was unexpected.</p><p>"What a perfect gift having my boys surprise me on stage last night," Brice writes in an Instagram caption accompanying the video of the sweet moment. "Happy anniversary my love! 'Boy' coming soon." The couple married in 2013 and are currently pregnant with their third child, <a href=#>a daughter,</a> expected in summer of 2017.</p><p>"Boy" is the first single off the country star's forthcoming 2017 album. The song is set to hit country radio around May 15. Brice tells <a href=#>Taste of Country</a> that the new track had the same impact as the CMA and ACM Award-winning song "I Drive Your Truck" did when he first heard it.</p><p>“It’s kind of like when I heard ‘Truck,’ it just stopped me … floored me. That’s what this song did," he admits. The new album also features a collaboration with one of his favorite singers, Edwin McCain.</p><p><strong>Country Music We Can't Wait for in 2017</strong></p><p><strong>See All Albums Slated for Release in 2017</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpZ2VYq%2BztcKeZJunqWLAsLrSZqanq6SWtKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
