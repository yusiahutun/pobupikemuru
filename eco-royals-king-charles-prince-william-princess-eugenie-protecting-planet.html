Even before he was crowned in September 2022, Charles has long made it his mission to introduce positive changes with regards to the environment. In the 1980s, His Majesty transformed <a class=hm-link href=#>Highgrove</a> into an organic haven limiting the use of antibiotics and other harmful chemicals.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0da7cf072998-highgrove-king-charles.jpg><p id=eHZsJnRAvw data-wc=33>He later set up Duchy Organic, with all profits going towards charitable causes via the King's own foundation.

Aside from turning down the heating at his swimming pool at Buckingham Palace, he has also switched the heating to biomass boilers at Birkhall, installed solar panels at Clarence House and had his Aston Martin converted to run on bioethanol made from cheese and wine. In an interview with the BBC, Charles said his car runs off "surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Charles arrives in his eco-friendly Aston DB6</figure><p id=eV7Jk5tda4p data-wc=38>When it comes to the world of fashion, the monarch is equally as committed to making positive environmental changes. He is a huge advocate for sustainable fashion and helped to launch The Campaign For Wool back in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9YzWo5SX2 data-wc=55>In an interview, the monarch said: "A major part of the change has to be moving from a linear system to a circular one, where textiles and clothing are produced sustainably, enjoy long use, and are made using natural materials, specifically wool, which will biodegrade naturally and quickly at the end of their useful life."</p><p id=enAaJdz3Cgd data-wc=13>Beyond this, Charles has also campaigned for conservation, organic farming and ecological solutions.</p><h2><strong>Prince William</strong></h2><p id=e5sk2AmXN2V data-wc=47><a class=hm-link href=#>The Prince of Wales</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>appears to be following in his father's green footsteps. Like father, like son, Prince William is also committed to protecting the environment. Most notably, he launched the Earthshot Prize in 2020, having been inspired by former US President John F. Kennedy's Moonshot project.&nbsp;</p><p id=eppiFyZuMUM data-wc=51>The global initiative is based on five 'Earthshot' goals: Protect and restore nature; Fix our climate; Clean our air; Revive our oceans; Build a waste-free world. Each year, five £1 million prizes are awarded, with the aim of providing at least 50 solutions to the world’s greatest environmental problems by 2030.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/989dd59c4e02-gettyimages-1236021623.jpg><p id=edNiFJe2Ueh data-wc=42>Following the late Queen's death in September 2022, Prince William said in a video message: "During this time of grief, I take great comfort in your continued enthusiasm, optimism and commitment to the Earthshot Prize and what we are trying to achieve.&nbsp;</p><p id=eegK4kUeg- data-wc=26>He continued: "Protecting the environment was a cause close to my grandmother's heart. And I know she would have been delighted to hear about this event."</p><h2><strong>Princess Eugenie</strong></h2><p id=eNaOUwlpoZP data-wc=45><a class=hm-link href=#>Sarah Ferguson</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Andrew's</a> daughter <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Eugenie</a> is passionate about the environment, particularly when it comes to the ocean. She has been incredibly vocal about the fight against ocean plastic pollution, and in 2021, she was appointed as an ambassador for Blue Marine Foundation.</p><p id=eLckH1xFu1e data-wc=26>Recently, she took part in the Solent Seascape Project and helped marine scientists to clean oysters in the university lab, before returning them to the sea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e7da1e67fa53-princess-eugenie-august.jpg><p id=ebW7bnONhZM data-wc=52>Beyond this, the 34-year-old is also committed to making positive changes at home. Speaking with Reuters editor-at-large Axel Threlfall and Arctic Humanity founder Gail Whiteman, Princess Eugenie said: "My son's going to be an activist from two years old, which is in a couple of days. So, he, everything is for them."&nbsp;</p><p id=eJ-9c1ILEK data-wc=36>Sharing a glimpse inside her family life, she continued:<strong>&nbsp;"At home we have no plastic, we try to as much as possible have no plastic and I'm trying to teach him that. But it's a battle."</strong></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eVk9BtnYWNM data-wc=38>To celebrate World Environment Day in 2021, Eugenie uploaded a wholesome photo featuring her husband Jack Brooksbank and their son August. In her caption, she wrote: "Thank you world for giving us such a beautiful place to live."</p><h2><strong>Amelia Windsor</strong></h2><p id=egjGxIDOagf data-wc=31>Model <a class=hm-link href=#>Amelia</a> is a notable eco warrior! The 28-year-old, who is the daughter of George Windsor, the Earl of St Andrews and Sylvana Tomaselli, is a staunch advocate for sustainable fashion.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKtA-3EK18f data-wc=45>While her love for secondhand clothing grew over lockdown, she has since made it her priority to champion small, sustainable brands such as Pretty Ballerinas, Penelope Chilvers, Been London, Brora and Alexander Clementine, who she collaborated with on a collection of underwear crafted from seaweed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c76b1fe98357-gettyimages-1531760339.jpg><p id=el1Mt5cjvvNF data-wc=23>During an exclusive interview with <strong></strong>, she said: "I think it was a case of a sudden realisation after being fed more information."</p><p id=e93g5LH7v_sj data-wc=30>She is also a patron for Cross River Gorilla Project. In a bid to save the critically endangered animal, she regularly raises awareness and supports the rangers in the rainforest.</p><h2><strong>Queen Camilla</strong></h2><p id=enM2GyClzbKu data-wc=25><a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Camilla</a> is an eco fashion queen! The thrifty royal regularly recycles items from her wardrobe and appears to be an advocate for 'slow fashion.'&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6c1e0a709fa6-queen-camilla-pink-coat.jpg><p id=eCZydhHCkV data-wc=59>In June last year, for instance, she stepped out at Royal Ascot wearing a familiar blush pink coat dress crafted by Anna Valentine - an item she'd previously worn to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's 2018 royal wedding. Meanwhile, in November 2023, Camilla re-wore her regal Bruce Oldfield gown that she originally donned for the monarch's coronation in May.</p><h2><strong>Prince Harry</strong></h2><p id=eyNFNTW_mNQW data-wc=42><a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry</a> founded sustainable tourism project Travalyst back in 2019 along with brands including Booking.com, Skyscanner, Tripadvisor, Trip.com and Visa.
