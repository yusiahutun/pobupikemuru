Combined with its wider handlebars, the V8 is one of the most comfortable and ergonomic scooters I've tested. It handles NYC's bumps, potholes, and hazardous roads without issue. The V8 is a scooter that you can ride anywhere—even off-road—though it can feel a little underwhelming with its acceleration and power, particularly with hills.</p><p>Even when riding on flat roads, the scooter can be quite slow off the line as it takes a few moments before the motor engages and actually begins to propel you forward. Compared to my smaller and aging Segway Ninebot, the V8 was noticeably slower than I was used to. The V8 has a max range of 50 miles, though unless you plan on riding this exclusively on flat roads at less than 10mph, it's more realistic to achieve 25–35 miles of real-world range.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyond that, this is an extremely heavy scooter, which could be problematic for those who need to carry it around or store it in a small space. In cities like NYC where you might frequent lots of stairs, especially entering or exiting a subway station or even your own apartment building (shout out to the 5 floor walk up), then this scooter is going to give you quite the workout. While it's on sale at $600, this is one of the best bang-for-your-buck escooters you can buy. Overall, the TurboAnt V8 electric scooter is a great choice for those who prioritize comfort and durability, but may not be the best option for those who want a more portable and powerful scooter.</p><h2 id=unboxing-and-setup>Unboxing and Setup</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-engaging-brakes.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it arrives, setting up your new TurboAnt V8 is very simple. After unboxing, you'll see that the V8 is fully assembled except for its handlebar. It took me a few moments to figure out how its locking mechanism worked in order to release the latch allowing for the scooter to unfold. After a few tries the latch came loose. I assume it just required a little more effort as it was brand new, and it seems to be easier to pull after several more uses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-right-side.jpg><p>The kickstand is already attached and can be used to keep the scooter upright during the next step. The handlebar is pre-wired but just needs to be slid above the vertical stem and screwed in with the included Allen key. There is a small pad keeping the battery from making contact. Once removed, the battery can fully slide in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-comparison-to-segway-ninebot.jpg><p>Just remove the protective film from the display, and you're ready to turn the V8 on. On the right side of the handlebar, you'll find your throttle which also doubles as your one input button. One long press turns the scooter on or off, one click turns the lights on or off, and double tapping changes power modes. Controls couldn't be easier, which is great when riding and making quick changes. Beyond this though, if you're expecting additional settings or customization than what's shown, you're out of luck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-installing-battery.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=turboant-v8-design-function-over-form>TurboAnt V8 Design: Function Over Form</h2><p>The TurboAnt V8 is far from flashy or sleek. Instead, this scooter looks like a tank, and it's built like one too with its blacked-out aluminum frame. Featuring IP54 water-resistance, it's capable of handling light rain and small puddles without any issues. Nevertheless, it's crucial to keep in mind that this rating doesn't provide complete waterproof protection, and the scooter may still suffer from water damage if it's exposed to heavy rain for an extended period or completely submerged in an unexpectedly deep puddle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-carrying-scooter.jpg><p>Unfolded, this measures 45.7 × 19.9 × 45.5 inches and folds down to 18.1 inches thick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-controls-display.jpg><p>Its 19.9 inch handlebars help you comfortably hold on without feeling too cramped, though taller riders might find its height to be too low. The deck is large enough to comfortably hold one rider at 6.9 inches wide and 19.7 inches long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-riding-back-view.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The deck has a rubberized textured grip that keeps your feet from sliding around. The TurboAnt V8 is designed with user comfort in mind, and one key feature that contributes to this is the dual spring suspension system built into the deck. This feature helps to absorb shock and reduce vibration while riding, providing a smoother and more comfortable experience for the rider. The suspension system is particularly useful when riding on bumpy or uneven terrain, as it helps to alleviate some of the stress on the rider's joints and muscles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-riding-towards-camera.jpg><p>Above its rear wheel, where you might typically find a manual brake, is a kick plate that can also help you position your feet in a more aggressive stance, though I can't see many users doing that. If you're the type to carry a passenger, the plate eats into the deck's depth a bit, making it too small to hold two comfortably. With its large air-filled 9.3-inch pneumatic inner tube tires, the V8 has 4.1 inches of ground clearance, which should be enough to traverse most obstacles. Even at higher speeds, I felt very confident as the V8 remained stable without any noticeable wobble or shake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is what it looks like next to my Segway Ninebot with its dual battery system.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-riding-scooter-with-boots.jpg><h2 id=hot-swappable-battery>Hot-Swappable Battery</h2><p>One of the unique features of the TurboAnt V8 electric scooter is its dual battery system, which allows for extended riding times without needing to stop and recharge. The scooter comes with two 36V, 7.5Ah lithium-ion batteries that can be hot-swapped, meaning you can change out a depleted battery for a fully charged one on the go. The TurboAnt V8 electric scooter comes with two chargers, one of which is specifically designed for a removable battery. This allows users to charge both batteries simultaneously, which can be a significant time saver. It takes approximately four hours to charge both batteries fully, which is a reasonable amount of time considering the extended riding time that comes with the dual-battery system.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-braking.jpg><p>This is a handy feature for riders who need to cover long distances or use the scooter for extended periods without access to a charging port. However, it's worth noting that having two batteries does add to the overall weight of the scooter, which may be a consideration for those who need to carry the scooter or store it in a small space.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-front-wheel-deck.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=operation>Operation</h2><p>The TurboAnt V8 uses a simple set of controls located on the handlebars. The right handlebar features a bell, brake lever, throttle, and power button, while the LED display is located between the handlebars. The display is rather simple, showing which of the three riding modes you're on, the speed, and how much battery is left. The left and right meters on the display show how hard you're pressing the brake lever or throttle, respectively.</p><p>To change any settings, you must press the power button a specific number of times, with long presses turning the V8 on and off, a single press turning on all the lights, and a double press switching between the three riding modes. âââââThe V8 has red âârear brake lights that flash when brakes are engaged. It has a 3W front light that has just one brightness level. Although they made me more visible to others, I wish they were brighter or perhaps pointed more downward to illuminate my path better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-brake-lever.jpg><h2 id=performance-and-experience>Performance and Experience</h2><p>If V8 had any implication on what to expect, you'd think this was the sports car of escooters. Instead, this is more akin to a powerful Toyota 4Runner rather than a lightning-quick BMW M5. That's not to say the TurboAnt is a bad scooter, but it's important to set expectations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-rear-brake-lights.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=power-modes>Power Modes</h2><p>The V8 provides three power modes, Eco (which tops at 6mph), Comfort (9mph), and Sport (20mph). As I'll cover in the following sections, even Sport mode feels tame enough that I imagine most riders wouldn't feel scared to ride in Sport. Eco and Comfort are likely only to be used when first learning to ride and get your bearings, though, if you have any previous experience on an escooter, you can easily jump straight to Sport.</p><p>The throttle feels very responsive and allows you to maintain speed and acceleration relatively well. I've tried other scooters which feel rather jerky in comparison. Just keep in mind that if you are looking for that instant torque and rush, this scooter doesn't satisfy that itch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-riding-fpv.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kickstart>Kickstart</h2><p>Like other budget escooters, you need to give the V8 a few kicks and get it moving before the throttle engages. Compared to my Nine-Bot, this helps avoid accidentally pulling the scooter away when you aren't ready. I felt somewhat underwhelmed, though, with its performance off the line, as the scooter was surprisingly slow.</p><p>Riding on the busy streets of NYC, and I was usually one of the slowest to get moving from a red light. I had to kick two or three times before the motor would take over, and even then, there was a delay in the power—even in Sport mode. Although I was still quicker than the manual bikes lined up, I was quickly passed by most ebikes and other escooters.</p><p>In NYC especially, this can be extremely difficult as you frequently have to go from a full stop if you want to make the next light before it changes to red. Just as important, as a defensive rider, that off-the-line performance can be critical for keeping you safe on the busy streets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-riding-scooter-into-sunset.jpg><p>When already in motion, it still never feels quick, even in its highest Sport power mode. The V8 can support up to 275 pounds, which is quite impressive. At about 5ft 10in and 160 pounds (72kg), with a combined weight of say, 170 pounds with all my gear, I'm probably a good representation of the "average" rider.</p><p>Although the V8 has a top speed of 20mph, it takes some time to get to those speeds, and it doesn't take too much to slow it down. Riding up smaller hills manages to reduce my top speed to about 15-16mph, and it can drop to as low as 12mph on steeper inclines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turboant-v8-riding-away-from-camera.jpg><h2 id=braking>Braking</h2><p>The TurboAnt V8 electric scooter has a dual braking system that includes a disc brake in the rear and an electronic brake in the front.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Both brakes are activated together when pulling on the single brake lever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was something I had to get used to as my other scooters had individual controls for the front and rear. While the electronic brake does a decent job of slowing down the scooter, it's not as strong as the disc brake, which provides more reliable and effective stopping power.</p><p>The braking performance of the V8 is generally satisfactory, but it's worth noting that the scooter takes longer to come to a complete stop than some other escooters on the market. I felt like the brake lever really needed to be pulled in if I wanted to come to a quick stop. Otherwise, it was quite mushy. I was very cautious when coming to a stop and would allow for extra stopping distance to ensure that I could come to a smooth stop instead of a jerky one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maintaining-slower-speeds>Maintaining Slower Speeds</h2><p>Surprisingly, the TurboAnt V8 struggles to go slower speeds. Because of how its throttle works, it makes tapping the throttle just a little to maintain anything less than 3mph very difficult. The scooter is rather unforgiving here and will frequently require you to kick again for the throttle to reengage.</p><p>Whether you're trying to stay slow to keep pace with someone walking or you're maneuvering tighter areas, the V8 does not make this easy. This was most noticeable when I tried to climb a sidewalk ramp to cross streets, but someone was walking in front of me. Instead of letting me climb up, the scooter's power wholly cut out and caused me to roll backward. This happened more times than I care to admit. Rather awkward and annoying to say the least.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike my Ninebot, the V8 can't be practically used as a push scooter in either its on or off-state. Instead, there is noticeable resistance, which makes it hard to roll. I found this rather odd, considering how the scooter requires you to kick up to speed before the motors engage. Tied in with the scooter not liking slower speeds, this makes it even more challenging to use the scooter in congested areas.</p><p>Oftentimes, I would simply get off the scooter completely and walk it instead.</p><h2 id=range>Range</h2><p>Although TurboAnt claims the V8 can achieve 50 miles of range, it's very unlikely that you get close to those numbers unless you really baby this scooter. I took an eight-mile ride from Third Ave Bridge in the Lower Bronx to Brooklyn Bridge in Chinatown, which took me about 1 hour to complete. It was about 33 degrees Fahrenheit, and the route mainly had flat roads but also a mix of hills too. I was of course riding in Sport mode and was frequently at full throttle. Although it took some time to get there, I had several legs of my ride where on flat stretches, I was maxing out the V8 at 20mph for several minutes straight before I hit the next red light. Going up hills, the V8 would quickly drop to about 15-16mph, but it still managed to carry me up for the most part without feeling too sluggish. While the V8 doesn't give you exact battery percentages, I estimate that this ride took about 40% of my battery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>I suppose with the right riding conditions with a completely flat road, minimal braking and acceleration, and keeping your top speed capped under 10mph or more, you could perhaps get closer to 40 miles or more of range. In reality, however, I imagine most users, like myself, are unlikely to ride extended periods like that.</p><h2 id=a-great-budget-scooter>A Great Budget Scooter?</h2><p>Overall, the TurboAnt V8 electric scooter is a well-built and comfortable option with a good range thanks to its dual batteries. However, it's quite heavy and lacks strong acceleration and reliable braking performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It's far from sporty, but it is still fun to ride on, though I do wish it had more power. Despite these drawbacks, the V8's performance is acceptable for its price point, making it a good choice for riders who prioritize budget and comfort. If you're in the market for an electric scooter that's durable, comfortable, and affordable, the TurboAnt V8 is definitely worth considering.</p><h3></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirrqqSpK6vwIyvb2ado5i8sMDEq2Srnaaesrh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
