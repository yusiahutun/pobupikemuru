According to Entertainment Tonight, Vanderpump Rules star Tom Sandoval was set to be a part of the Winter House cast for Season 3, however, he was cut after news broke of his<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> affair—now known as Scandoval</a>—involving his ex-girlfriend, Ariana Madix, and their co-star, Raquel Leviss.

Amanda, who was on Winter House Seasons 1 and 2, was missing from the premiere of Season 3 because she was at a bachelorette party. “Amanda! What’s up, how was the bachelorette?” Amanda’s husband, Kyle Cooke, asked her on a FaceTime call in the premiere. “I’m very happy in my element.” Kyle then told Amanda that he missed her, to which Amanda responded, “I don’t. I mean, I love you. I don’t feel like I miss you just yet.”</p><p>In a confessional interview, Kyle explained that he wished Amanda was with him on Winter House Season 3, but he understood why she needed a break. “I love Amanda. I wish she was here, but at the same time, I am a lot for her to handle. For a couple days, I can let my freak flag fy since no one is there to chop it down.”</p><p>Amanda confirmed on her call with Kyle that she’ll arrive to the winter house in “a few days.” However, her arrival seemed to be delayed even further after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amanda came down with a “sudden illness”</a> and couldn’t travel. “Despite being the only married man in the house, Kyle Cooke (Summer House) still loves to party with his single friends, and hopes to watch sparks fly between them. He is looking forward to getting some work-free time to bond with his wife, Amanda Batula (Summer House), but after a sudden illness delays her arrival out West, an even more unexpected situation comes their way,” reads Kyle and Amanda’s official biography for Winter House Season 3 on Bravo’s website.</p><p>However, despite the delays, Amanda is a full-time cast member on Winter House Season 3. Amanda also <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>confirmed she was a cast member</a> on Winter House Season 3 in an Instagram post in September 2023.</p><p>“WinterHouse Season 3 premieres October 24th on @BravoTV!” she captioned her official cast photo for the season.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8526315789474><h2>Who's in the Winter House cast for Season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Winter-House-Cast-Season-3.jpg><p>Read on for the full Winter House cast for Season 3, including which original Bravo show each cast member is from.</p><ul><li>Kyle Cooke (Summer House)</li><li>Amanda Batula (Summer House)</li><li>Jason Cameron (Winter House)</li><li>Kory Keefer (Winter House)</li><li>Brian Benni (Family Karma)</li><li>Jordan Emanuel (Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard)</li><li>Katie Flood (Below Deck Mediterranean)</li><li>Danielle Olivera (Summer House)</li><li>Alex Propson (Below Deck Sailing Yacht)</li><li>Tom Schwartz (Vanderpump Rules)</li><li>Malia White (Below Deck Mediterranean)</li><li>Casey Craig (Winter House)</li><li>Sam Feher (Summer House) — Guest</li><li>Rhylee Gerber (Below Deck) — Guest</li><li>Aesha Scott (Below Deck Down Under) — Guest</li><li>Sandy Yawn (Below Deck Mediterranean) — Guest</li></ul><p>Winter House airs on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.
