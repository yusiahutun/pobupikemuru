The investigation was also triggered by a referral from another regulator, which the council did not identify, as well as a complaint from a member of the public.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Next Digital, which has been suspended from trading since June 17 when the police arrested some of its key executives, missed its scheduled results announcement on June 28 for the year ended March, as its current auditor Tandem (HK) CPA said it needed more time to complete its job.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Next Digital’s books and two auditors under investigation</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfl66vt8innmaemaOur6%2FEaJirrJmYuaZ7kmprbm1hbnypu82gZKSnnpzAbq3CnKaupqSeu6h51pqrnKCUpLRutc2vnKysmZyutbGMmqeppJVisaK1y7I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
