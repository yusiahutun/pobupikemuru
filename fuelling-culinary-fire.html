Growing up, executive Chinese chef Jayson Tang of Man Ho Chinese Restaurant at the JW Marriott Hotel Hong Kong used to lend a hand at his parents’ dai pai dong, or street food stall, selling milk tea, sandwiches and other traditional Hong Kong breakfast delights.
Tang vividly remembers how his father took great care to look sharp, dressing in a long-sleeved shirt and trousers even on hot days, and how extremely particular he was with the produce delivered to the stall daily."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I do it in person, and together with them.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This connection that Tang maintains in the kitchen carries over to the table, as ultimately the team is working to present their very best food to the guests, he says.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Other than satisfying one’s hunger, food is also for conveying feelingsExecutive chef Jayson Tang, Man Ho Chinese Restaurant at JW Marriott Hotel Hong Kong</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tang is so in tune with the guests’ needs and preferences that he may be one of the few chefs – if not the only one – who claims not to have a personal “signature dish”, as he prefers to work according to his guests’ tastes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I often tell people that the dish that impresses the most number of guests is our signature dish,” he says, citing Man Ho’s fresh fish soup with fish maw and assorted seafood, as well as the steamed egg with flathead lobster, dried fish roe and saffron, as examples.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tang also makes it a point to chat with guests as his shift ends every evening, in order to ensure they had been satisfied with what was served. “Their happiness at the end of the meal gives me great satisfaction.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This inimitable passion for and joy derived from cooking for others is key to Tang’s calling as a chef. “Other than satisfying one’s hunger, food is also for conveying feelings,” he says. “The emotional connections involved [with my team and guests] are essential.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Explore Man Ho Chinese Restaurant <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">here</span></a>.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Trishna Mahtani contributed to this report.</p><img aria-label=loading data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6LAyK%2BcaKSZm7K0wNilnGisn6W2pL%2BOn6yepJyeu6h5wq6joqaRp8ZussirnGiZoqm2pLjEaGpqbGRrgHd7zJqlZqCf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
