After graduating from high school, Claudia attended Millsaps College, where she met her future husband Bob Burnett. They married in 1960 and moved to Starkville. She graduated from Mississippi State University with a double-major in English and History.</span></p><p><span>Claudia was a proud Mississippi State alumna and enjoyed keeping up with the Bulldogs. If one called her during any of their games, she would answer with a hearty, “Hail State!”</span></p><p><span>Claudia’s career in education spanned more than 30 years. The majority of those years were spent as a seventh-grade English teacher at Bay Springs</span><span>Middle School. She also taught some high school English, History and French. She gladly helped anyone and “lovingly” corrected everyone with the proper usage of the English language.</span></p><p><span>She was an inspirational teacher, advocating for her students to take field trips to appreciate the fine arts. Claudia continued to help her students well after they left her classroom, often assisting them in writing speeches and papers for both high school and college. Her primary goal was to instill in all a love for learning and for being educated.</span></p><p><span>She was quite funny and extremely quick-witted. She enjoyed reading most everything, playing bridge, sewing and crocheting. She was always happy to share her library of books and to sew for loved ones. Seeing Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash in person as a teen shaped her love for music.</span></p><p><span>By far, Claudia’s most admirable attribute was welcoming all into her home and treating everyone as family. Her hospitality knew no bounds. She was known for her exceptional cooking, most notably her potato salad and cornbread.</span></p><p><span>Claudia was a devout Christian and believed wholeheartedly in the Word of God. She was a leader and member of Bay Springs Presbyterian Church for more than 50 years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Claudia was preceded in death by her parents Carolyn Jackson McMullen, William Lucas McMullen Sr. and Ann Allred McMullen; her husband John Robert “Bob” Burnett Sr.; her sister Betty McMullen Harrington; and her brother Bobby Glenn Allred.</span></p><p><span>Survivors include her son John Robert Burnett Jr. (Clare) of Port Gibson; her daughters Betsy Burnett McCurdy (John) of Oxford and Chrissy Burnett Zollenberg (David) of New York City; her brothers William Lucas McMullen Jr. and George Wayne Allred; her sister Sylvia Allred Adamson; her grandchildren John Robert Burnett III (Kelsey), Dr. Luke Burnett (Caitlin), Grace Caroline Burnett, J.W. McCurdy (Megan) and Meg McCurdy; eight great-grandchildren; and a host of nieces and nephews.</span></p><p><span>The family extends its heartfelt gratitude to her caregivers: the family of Judy Moody, Jo Ann Moody Thompson, Doug Gammage, Alexis Campbell and Laquita Moody.</span></p><p><span>Visitation will be at Colonial Chapel Funeral Home of Bay Springs at 10 a.m. on Saturday, March 9. A memorial service will follow at 11:30 a.m. officiated by Pastor Phil McRae.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnk6GutrDImmShnZ6nxm65wqaspaSVo3qjwdGnnK2sX5a%2FtbXCpZyYa5aZhnp9lG9knZuTbXpyfcSeZHJtZ2p6dn%2FBm5xtnmJrgniAjaGrpqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
