The go-to accessible label for off-duty Californian style (Cindy Crawford, Kendall Jenner and Emily Ratajkowski are all fans), Rails has gone from small start-up to a fully fledged empire sold in more than 40 countries around the world - including two new stores in London in the desirable locations of Covent Garden and Westbourne Grove.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While other fashion companies were forced to close as a result of the pandemic, Rails benefitted from shoppers’ newfound interest in comfortable clothing - its easy loungewear, sleep sets and jumpers felt even more appealing as we worked from home. And comfort is key to the brand; so important, in fact, that it develops its own fabrics to create almost cashmere-like softness. “The ‘hand-feel’ of our brand is such a major component in why we’ve been successful,” says founder and LA native Jeff Abrams. “People being in a store to feel our fabrics was super important as we evolved. [Covid] turned out to be a good time to invest in retail as a lot of people were closing their doors, and we were one of the few people going to landlords saying we want to buy a space.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Our product makes people feel something special<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If the brand was a much-loved insider secret before Covid, there has been a groundswell since. The growth of Rails in the past year alone is impressive - its e-commerce business has increased by 200 per cent, while its wholesale avenue is up by 125 per cent. Popularity is so high for certain styles, including its <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://uk.railsclothing.com/products/syd-black?_pos=1&_sid=1b4e6096a&_ss=r" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="flattering Syd LBD" data-vars-ga-product-id=4995e950-4ffb-4679-86c3-65e44642a85a data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://uk.railsclothing.com/products/syd-black?_pos=1&_sid=1b4e6096a&_ss=r" data-product-url="https://uk.railsclothing.com/products/syd-black?_pos=1&_sid=1b4e6096a&_ss=r" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.railsclothing.com%2Fproducts%2Fsyd-black%3F_pos%3D1%26_sid%3D1b4e6096a%26_ss%3Dr" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=£220.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=bfdfe3d0-ea15-4438-b5ad-eb5f1d8de3eb class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">flattering Syd LBD</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://uk.railsclothing.com/products/perci-sweater-ivory-daisies?_pos=1&_sid=3d482d9c9&_ss=r" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="daisy-covered Perci jumper" data-vars-ga-product-id=3bb447d7-5675-47d3-858c-8490978ed9f2 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://uk.railsclothing.com/products/perci-sweater-ivory-daisies?_pos=1&_sid=3d482d9c9&_ss=r" data-product-url="https://uk.railsclothing.com/products/perci-sweater-ivory-daisies?_pos=1&_sid=3d482d9c9&_ss=r" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.railsclothing.com%2Fproducts%2Fperci-sweater-ivory-daisies%3F_pos%3D1%26_sid%3D3d482d9c9%26_ss%3Dr" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=£188.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=ef3586a7-d8f7-4e95-b6d9-bb5f06072f75 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">daisy-covered Perci jumper</a>, that they have to be regularly restocked. Its mail-order catalogue, made using recycled paper, reaches more than one million customers every season. “We’re making classic styles that customers can wear season after season,” he says. “It’s not totally fashion-driven, we’re not fast fashion. Our product makes people feel something special.”</p><img alt=rails title=Rails width=1651 height=2477 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/leni-black-2-1650464104.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>The Leni dress, £220</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rails has tapped into a broad customer demographic - you’re as likely to see a 50+ woman in one of the timeless shirts or versatile white midi dresses, as much as you are a 20-something in one of its floral, flippy minis. “There’s very much a mother-daughter customer buying our brand,” says Abrams. “If I was thinking about a celebrity family who epitomises our world, it would be the Crawfords: Cindy, Randi, Kaia and Presley. We’re consistent; we offer pieces that are true to the heritage of the brand, but we also deliver newness so there’s a reason to come back.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>It helps when women like Gisele and Kendall Jenner wear our shirts<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Abrams first launched his label in 2008 after an inter-railing trip round Europe gave him the idea of fusing breezy Californian style with European elegance. Without any technical background in fashion, he started small with caps and hoodies, touting his wares as a door-to-door salesman. Before long, he created what would be Rails’ signature - <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.revolve.com/dp/RAIL-WS815/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Hunter shirt" data-vars-ga-product-id=24008327-89a1-4d67-bafe-4fb55c3f04f1 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.revolve.com/dp/RAIL-WS815/ data-product-url=https://www.revolve.com/dp/RAIL-WS815/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.revolve.com%2Fdp%2FRAIL-WS815%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=Rails data-vars-ga-product-price=$75.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=ce7f0090-1e6b-44af-8f0f-a559a11b9fd1 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Rails data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Blouses & Button-Down Shirts" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">the Hunter shirt</a> in cotton plaid. It was a great style, but without a real point of difference, which led him to consider the material more deeply. “I had this scarf that was super drapey in a Tencel-blend, so I went to the factory that was making our shirts and said I wanted to make our shirt in this particular fabric,” he recalls. “We went through a bunch of iterations that would be durable enough to last as a shirt, but soft enough to be elegant in a casual way. Once I had that, we spent every season doing fabric innovation in a lot of categories.”</p><img alt=rails title=Rails width=2560 height=1707 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/april-creme-marnie-creme-2-1650464301.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Marnie trousers, £200; April top, £218</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The next big milestone came in 2015 when supermodel Gisele wore a Rails shirt to the Super Bowl to watch her husband Tom Brady play. The image of her wearing it was plastered over every television screen in the US and beyond, and within seconds, the style sold out. “We weren’t really direct-to-consumer at the point, so we had a website but it wasn’t optimised to handle that amount of people,” laughs Abrams. “Certainly, it helps when women like Gisele and Kendall Jenner wear our shirts.”</p><img alt="gisele wearing a rails shirt at super bowl" title="Gisele wearing a Rails shirt at Super Bowl" width=3456 height=5184 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gisele-bundchen-wife-of-tom-brady-of-the-new-england-news-photo-1650464527.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andy Lyons</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Gisele wearing a Rails shirt at the Super Bowl in 2015</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As we move beyond the pandemic, the Rails woman has migrated to versatile dresses, slouchy tailoring and also to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://uk.railsclothing.com/collections/denim data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=denim data-vars-ga-product-id=85f29745-9a21-454b-8a45-95ef96e97d3c data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://uk.railsclothing.com/collections/denim data-product-url=https://uk.railsclothing.com/collections/denim data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.railsclothing.com%2Fcollections%2Fdenim" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=£180.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=4718c4b2-29c9-42c3-a483-f9e3ba23cccf class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">denim</a>, the label’s latest new category.

Customers want more access to what you’re making, but also to who you are and what you stand for.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a challenging time for retail, Rails proves that a great product that speaks to what the shopper wants and needs will get you everywhere. “When you first start a business, everyone always wants to tell you no - they tell you someone else is doing that, or we already have a similar line that we carry,” says Abrams. “Perseverance is critical to anyone starting a business: you have to fight through all of the nos to eventually get a little momentum that will carry you forward.”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Celebrities wearing vintage fashion" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/vintage-fashion-thumb-1649325289.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmTEqa3TZquoZaearrN7wGxwcG9ibYV6e9GaoKWrXZuutLTIqKVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
