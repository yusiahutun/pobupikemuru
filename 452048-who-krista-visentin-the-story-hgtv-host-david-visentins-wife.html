The major problem with being the spouse of a famous personality is that one's life is overshadowed, and people often assume they are in the same profession or don't care. Many individuals are unaware that Krista is in the <a href=#>real estate</a> <a href=#>business</a>, buying, renting, and selling properties.</p><h2>Krista and David Visentin’s relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg><p class=align-left>Krista is married to David Visentin.

Despite David being a famous television personality, he only invited close friends and <a href=#>family</a>. It is now more than ten years after their marriage, and the relationship looks strong. Also, they keep their union private, and there's rarely anything concrete in public.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f32863c147a96f88.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Melanie Bright: 5 interesting facts about Lynette Nusbacher's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>David and Krista welcomed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">their only son</a>, Logan Visentin, on March 30, 2011.

In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">realtor.com</a>, David confessed that he and Hilary are good friends and hang out a lot. It is probably why people think that they might have been dating.</p>We're good friends; we hang out outside the show. We go out for dinners, talk about the show, talk about life. But we're both fairly competitive. So, even outside of the show, we've been known to banter, and we have to be very careful when we're in public because sometimes we'll start in on each other. So, what you see on the show is kind of our relationship.<h2>Krista Visentin's net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Krista has accumulated her wealth from her real estate job and has an estimated net worth of $1 million as of 2022. Krista's husband, on the other hand, has an estimated net worth of $6 million.
