Our thoughts hold immense power— you can attract whatever you desire into your life by simply asking for it (yes, really!) and truly believing what’s meant for you will come. The ritual of manifestation can easily be incorporated into your daily life through a variety of ways, whether it be writing down your desires or by using additional tools to guide you."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ritual of manifestation</a> can easily be incorporated into your daily life through a variety of ways, whether it be writing down your desires or by using additional tools to guide you. Believe it or not, using the power of scent can be one of them.&nbsp;</p><p>The TikTok-viral <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">11 11 Eau de Parfum</a> from Lake & Skye may seem like any other “clean girl” fragrance, but the meaning behind its name holds more weight than you can imagine. If you’re curious how this seemingly normal <a href=# id=auto-tag_perfume data-tag=perfume>perfume</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_manifestation data-tag=manifestation>manifestation</a> go hand in hand, StyleCaster’s Astrology Editor, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Roya Backlund</a>, is here to explain.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>“Because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">11 11 Eau de Parfum</a> carries notes of white amber, it is already charged with power. After all, amber has been considered the ‘nectar of the gods’ since ancient times,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>“After applying the fragrance to yourself, take a few deep breaths and allow the scent to flood your imagination. Remember—scent can activate memory recall and put you in a more creative, dreamlike state of mind. Whenever you feel ready, define what you want to manifest in straightforward terms, describing it in the present tense, as though you’re already living it.”&nbsp;</p><p>Examples of phrases to use can be as simple as “I am highly successful. Money flows towards me with ease….I attract love and make friends everywhere I go. Everyone adores me…I am in love with my soul mate, who loves me back.”</p><p>Roya advises taking it all in, feeling the emotions of your desired reality, and using the power of this scent to merge with the magic of your manifestation. Every time you wear it and breathe in this scent, you can “tune into the frequency of your desired reality.” Wearing this scent will only amplify it.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lake-skye-perfume.jpg><p>You can also take the name behind the perfume to hold its own significance. As Los Angeles–based Spiritual Advisor, Meghan Rose, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>previously wrote for StyleCaster</a>, “In&nbsp;numerology, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>meaning of 1111 as an angel number</a>&nbsp;runs deep. After all, it is said that 11:11, 11/11, and 1111 in each form holds its own spiritual significance. Some interpret this divine number as a message from the universe, letting them know that they are on the right path.” Essentially, there’s a lot of potential that can come from bringing this scent into your life.</p><p>Not to mention, the aroma of the scent itself has made it famous alone on TikTok, putting it very much in the category of the “clean girl” aesthetic.</p><p>As one TikToker put it, “To me it smells fresh, crisp and airy. It’s definitely in that clean linen perfume category. But there’s just something that stands out about it from other fresh and clean fragrances. I can smell this on clothes for well after 8 hours, so the longevity is there.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>The brand even describes the scent as “sheer, clean and uplifting with an ethereal vibe with a crisp texture and transparency,” and one reviewer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the website</a> wrote “It’s the perfect ‘clean girl’ scent. Reminds me of the shower after being in the pool on a warm day.”</p><p>What more reasoning could you need to make this your next signature scent? Pick up a bottle of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>11 11 Eau de Parfum</a> to start attracting what you deserve and desire. The fragrance is currently available in a 50ml size (the 100ml is currently sold out,) alongside a in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>hydrating all-over body oil</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGasopq7pb%2BOam1raGFng3C4wKScZqubrrJufZBmaGpllZbCbrDEZqeaqpaqunA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
