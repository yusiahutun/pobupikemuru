Protection-oriented products that replaced income upon death or other events had not been as popular in Asia as they were in the west, but Mr Cheng expected that to change with the maturing of the region's insurance market."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

RGA has offices in 16 countries and has had a presence in Hong Kong for 11 years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Protection-oriented products that replaced income upon death or other events had not been as popular in Asia as they were in the west, but Mr Cheng expected that to change with the maturing of the region's insurance market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">RGA accepted risks on insurance policies that were originally written by life insurance companies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'We reinsure nearly anything that has to do with the human body, including medical, life and cancer insurance,' Mr Cheng explained.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'If a company doesn't want to take the chance that someone will die and they would have to pay out a large sum, say $10 million [in death benefits], they reinsure and sell us the risk.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">RGA does not engage in property or casualty reinsurance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the past, reinsurers tended to be passive players who relied on long-term business relationships, but Mr Cheng said his company had adopted a more proactive approach, which had helped make it the second-largest life reinsurer in Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'How do reinsurers compete to gain this automatic business? One way is by offering the most competitive price, or relying on the strongest history or credit rating. 'But in my mind the best way to encourage clients to give us more business is to say 'we will help you develop the products you currently do not have',' he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Reinsurers are remunerated for their product development services with reinsurance contracts, rather than consultation fees. Mr Cheng said RGA worked with its life insurance company clients by assessing both their needs and market demands to create new insurance products. This could result in a brand-new product or the modification of an existing one.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Recent RGA-driven products included whole-life medical policies with a guaranteed premium rate, along with lifetime coverage and preferred life insurance products that offered discounts for policyholders who had above-average health or who had healthy lifestyles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'When the Hong Kong government announced its desire to move the health burden from the public to the private sector, there was an opportunity for us to develop the whole-life medical product,' Mr Cheng said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Preferred life insurance originated in the US, but RGA saw a potential market in Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Instead of just selling term insurance, this was a way to break up the pool of people so that preferred policyholders could get more competitive rates,' he said. 'As the Asian markets mature and as the Asian consumer becomes more discerning, this product will continue to take off.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other recent RGA products included high net worth universal life insurance and cancer insurance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'The high net worth product was imported from the US and is targeted at the very wealthy. But many wealthy people are secretive about their personal financial information. One of the keys to these products is to find creative means of obtaining the information we need in a way the consumer is comfortable with,' Mr Cheng said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">RGA developed a cancer insurance policy with a client who found a coverage gap in certain existing policies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Many critical illness products have the cancer element in them, but they generally cover only late-stage cancer and serve a different need. Our client's product pays a portion of the benefit at an earlier stage of cancer, when it is most needed. This early payment funds treatment and will ultimately prevent some cancers from moving into the final and more terminal stages,' Mr Cheng said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdlaYZ5fJNoqaCZXamurLHSZp%2BemZyptbp5wqGYp5uVYsSpu8ueZKWhlpp6pLvVnqman5U%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
