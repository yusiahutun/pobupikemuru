The legendary country star, Dolly Parton, once turned down Kate Middleton – now the Princess of Wales – and the whole situation is all sorts of iconic. Dolly, music legend, explained how she was recently invited to sit down with Princess Catherine. Although previous royals have had high-flying connections, it’s not as common to hear in the current era of the British monarchy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Dolly, <a href=#>music</a> legend, explained how she was recently invited to sit down with Princess Catherine. Although previous <a href=#>royals</a> have had high-flying connections, it’s not as common to hear in the current era of the British monarchy. <a href=#>Princess Diana</a> was one of the guests to <a href=#>Joan Rivers’ penthouse</a> when she would have parties. But celebrity gatherings with royals nowadays are more low-key. Except when Dolly comes in, apparently.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-middleton-invited-dolly-parton-for-afternoon-tea>Kate Middleton invited Dolly Parton for afternoon tea</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1047946224-1024x760.jpg><p>Yes, you read that right. Kate Middleton invited Dolly Parton for afternoon tea. You definitely can’t get any more British than that.</p><p>The two vastly different worlds almost collided with a strong cup of English tea. Only it never happened.</p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> legend Parton explained how the invite happened when she was on BBC Radio 2.</p><p>She had been working in London when she got the call.</p><p>Dolly said, in true Dolly fashion: “This time, Lordy, I even got invited to have tea with Kate, but I couldn’t even go.”</p><p>But she had to confirm she didn’t end up going. She added: “I thought it was very sweet and nice of her to invite me, and one of these days I’m going to get to do that – that would be great.”</p><p>And why didn’t Dolly Parton sit down with Kate Middleton for finger sandwiches?</p><p>“She wasn’t going to promote my rock album, so I had to say no,” the star joked.</p><p>We all know how hard-working the 77-year-old is, and she shows no signs of stopping just yet. Hopefully, next time she pops over to the UK, she can sit down with the future Queen Consort. Maybe, she’ll get to see <a href=#>Prince William</a> as well, unless it’s a girls’ trip.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-s-celebrity-friends>Meghan Markle’s celebrity friends</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1239015246-1024x683.jpg><p>Despite some members of The Firm keeping their pals hush-hush, we do know <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>‘s celebrity pals.</p><p>A lot of them stem from her years acting on the hit TV show Suits. She later left the showbiz world when she exchanged vows with <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>.</p><p>But she’s known to rub shoulders with Tennis champ Serena Williams as well as Priyanka Chopra, who wed Nick Jonas.</p><p>Let us not forget Meghan being chummy with legendary host Oprah Winfrey. The royal couple are neighbors to the billionaire in their <a href=#>hotspot home of Montecito, California</a>.</p><p>After stepping down as senior members of the royal family in 2020, the pair sat down for a bombshell interview with Oprah the following year.</p><p>Reports say Beyoncé and Ellen are among the inner <a href=#>celebrity</a> circle as well. There’s also Gwyneth Paltrow, health guru, who is said to be in her close friend’s list, which <a href=#>Meghan is seeking inspiration for in relation to her next venture.</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2h%2BcLDOpaOyZaCWv7W7zWarrqqemrFusM6wpWajkamybrnInZulnaSku7R5yKetoqyRqbawuoyfpqtlpJqubrWMnKaupJSjwW6zzmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
