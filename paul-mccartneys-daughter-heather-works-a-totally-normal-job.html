However, Heather McCartney is one of the <a href=#>kids of celebrities that work completely normal jobs</a>, unlike her three adult siblings. Per <a href=#>Hello!</a> Mary McCartney followed in her mom's footsteps and is a successful photographer; Stella McCartney is a fashion designer with her own luxury clothing empire, while James McCartney is a musician and even collaborates on tracks with his dad. But Heather prefers a lower profile.</p><p><a href=#>Hollywood Life</a> reports that she studied ceramics at art school, and after graduating, she worked as a professional potter. In 1999, she released the Heather McCartney Houseware Collection, inspired by her time in Mexico. Heather enjoys a simpler and more private life than her siblings. She lives on her dad's estate in East Sussex and keeps entirely off social media.</p><p>Paul McCartney recently talked about his role as a father and how it's changed over the years. "As far as being a dad is concerned, I've always just tried to give my kids a bit of guidance if they seem to need it — but that was mainly when they were younger," he told <a href=#>PaulMcCartney.com</a>. "Now that they are older, they're guiding me! They don't need so much guidance these days, but if there's ever a problem, I'm very happy to be the guy they come to."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampiZ355gI6pmK6kXaKwpK3RraWesaNisaLBxqGrnqpdnbKiwMeeqWavn6e4tHnAZquorJGhubp5zaipppmcYrewro4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
