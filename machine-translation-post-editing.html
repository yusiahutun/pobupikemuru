But what is machine translation post-editing (MTPE)?  
Well, read on to find out.    
What is machine translation post-editing?  Simply put, Machine translation post-editing refers to a hybrid translation model where any translations made by a machine is reviewed by a human editor."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For one, it cuts <strong>down the time</strong> needed for manual translations especially when dealing with large volumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, it improves <strong>translation accuracy</strong> since human editors can easily catch costly errors and mistakes that machines miss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And last but not least, MTPE allows for a translation to have that <strong>human touch</strong>. By using human editors, the translated texts end up sounding more natural and read fluently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best practices for machine translation post-editing&nbsp;</h2><p>Even as we’ve seen the benefits of MTPE, you shouldn’t jump into it right away. Here are a few best practices to consider before opting to use it:&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Choose the right machine translation engine&nbsp;</h3><p>Each machine translation (MT) engine is more suitable for different languages and content types. For instance, some MT systems will provide <strong>better outputs</strong> translating Asian languages, while others, European languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, evaluate each machine translation engine to determine which one suits your needs and <strong>target audience best</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Use a high-quality source text&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.2.-Use-a-high-quality-source-text.jpg><p>Since MT engines are still in their early development stages, they are not very effective in translating text that’s too technical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, <strong>check</strong> to ensure that your original text doesn’t have too much jargon, and the sentence structures aren’t too complex.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Understand common MT errors&nbsp;</h3><p>During the editing process, you can make your work easier by <strong>familiarizing</strong> yourself with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">common errors</a> that a machine makes. This could be anything from mistranslated phrases to factual errors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With this information, your editor will know exactly where to focus their attention.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Provide relevant terminology and style guide&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>When working with a large team of editors you should consider <strong>providing reference documents</strong>, glossaries, and style guides. This will ensure that your final output after editing remains consistent, even when you hire new editors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Continuously evaluate MTPE performance&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.3.-Continuously-evaluate-MTPE-performance.jpg><p>As you continue to offer translation services, it’s good to conduct a<strong> continuous evaluation</strong> of your MTPE system. Check for its accuracy, consistency, fluency, and adherence to client standards, to determine where it needs improvement.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use feedback loops between translators, editors, and your clients to help in the evaluation.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Final thoughts&nbsp;</h2><p>There’s a lot to <a href=#>gain from machine translation post-editing</a>. By blending human editors and machine translators, businesses, and organizations can enjoy faster and cheaper translation services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And by following these best practices, you can be sure that MTPE will deliver quality translations that meet your client’s needs.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLqir8eipZ5lpKeur7%2FLmquip55ivbC%2F02acnaGknruo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
