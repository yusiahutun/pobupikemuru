The easiest way to make this a reality is by building a strong web of like-minded individuals who share your interests and vision. Collaborating isn’t just about interoffice; it extends to virtual teams too.</p><p>Several organizations do have a dedicated employee engagement portal for exchanging ideas. While off-site events, intranets, and other traditional platforms are great for employee engagement, these “integrated workspaces” extend the promise of a digital-age “open-door” to everyone within a company.

The key is to pace yourself and to know when enough is enough—cut back, take some time off, or just focus on one single task or project at a time.

But when working with teams, it can sometimes conflict with the need to listen to others' opinions. In the process, you may come across as an overly assertive personality, or you may get caught up with the little details so much that it can disrupt your ability to meet deadlines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keep in mind that you will need to be open to different ways of thinking and the opinions of your team members, which will result in positive outcomes for everyone involved.
