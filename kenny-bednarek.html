He specializes in the 200-meter sprint and is considered one of the best sprinters in the country. He earned silver medals at the 2020 Summer Olympics and the 2022 World Championships.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Kenny Bednarek was born on October 14, 1998, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Kenny and his identical twin sibling Ian were adopted by Mary Bednarek and relocated to Rice Lake, Wisconsin. Beginning in the second grade, both brothers began participating in junior track. Kenny played for Rice Lake High School in his school days.</p><p>He even won seven individual state championships and led his team to the 4400 relay title. His performance of 20.43 seconds in the 200-meter dash at the high school level was the best in the country in 2018. Since he did not have the grades to go into a big four-year college, he decided to attend Indian Hills Community College in Ottumwa, Iowa.</p><p>Bednarek ran the second-fastest indoor 200-meter time in the United States at Indian Hills. It also placed him at number thirteen on the all-time indoor list. Bednarek received the honor of “USATF Athlete of the Week” on May 22, 2019, for his efforts in the sport.</p><h3>Kenny Bednarek Career</h3><p>In July 2019, he departed Indian Hills and signed a professional contract with Nike. He began training with former world champion and Olympic medalist Justin Gatlin in Florida. Bednarek reached the finals of the 200-meter dash at the 2019 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. He had a hamstring injury during the final, but he still managed to jog across the finish line.</p><p>Winning the 200-meter event in the 2019 IAAF Diamond League later in the season earned Noah Lyles a bye to the World Athletics Championships. The United States was consequently granted a second admission. Bednarek earned his spot at the World Championships by finishing fourth at the National Championships and so meeting the qualifying time requirement.</p><p>Bednarek’s nervousness flared up weeks after his injury, and he could only manage a 21.50 in his heat, which wasn’t good enough to advance. Bednarek ran a world-record time of 19.80 +1.0 at the Star Athletics Sprint Showcase in Montverde, Florida on August 10, 2020, during the COVID-19 shortened season. His new time placed him in a tie for the 25th-fastest time of all time.</p><h4>Rise to Fame</h4><p>Bednarek earned the silver medal in the men’s 200-meter final at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics with a time of 19.68 seconds on August 4, 2021. At the 2021 Weltklasse Meet in Zürich on September 9th, Bednarek ran a season-best 19.70 seconds to win the Diamond League 200-meter title.</p><p>Kenny has the most sub-20 performances in a single season in 2021, with 12 overall sub-20 performances, 10 of which were wind-legal efforts over 200 meters. He finished the season as World Athletics’ No. 1 200-meter runner.</p><p>Bednarek ran a silver-medal 200-meter time of 19.77 seconds at the 2022 World Athletics Championships on July 21 in Eugene, Oregon. His opponent in Tokyo, Noah Lyles, ran a new American record of 19.31 seconds.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Kenny Bednarek Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Kenny Bednarek</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>14 October 1998&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>24 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Track and Field Athlete&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Indian Hills Community College</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 2” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 188 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 86 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 189 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kenneth-Bednarek-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Mary Bednarek</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Ian Bednarek</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>In Relation</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Is he a Lesbian?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Girlfriend</td><td>Sharmila Nicollet</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Kenny is in a relationship with pro golfer Sharmila Nicollet.
