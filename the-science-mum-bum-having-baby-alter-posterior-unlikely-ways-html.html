The hip flexor muscles, found at the front of the hip, become overactive and tight and the glutes generally under-active, leading to poor muscle tone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Many of us already have dormant glutes, which need waking up and activating in order to perk up our posteriors, and pregnancy exacerbates this problem.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Pregnant women often struggle to stand comfortably. ‘You may find that you put weight on one leg then the other, or lock knees. Ideally, to protect your lower back from aches, stand on both feet, hip distance apart, with a micro-bend in the knee and let the bottom drop a little. However, this can mean weaker glutes.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>TARGET AND TONE</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Resistance training is the best form of exercise for firming up the bottom,’ says Cornel Chin.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Such exercises as squats will firm up the gluteal muscles.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You can’t spot-reduce fat,’ he points out. ‘However, you can, target muscle toning.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Clare Maddalena says: ‘One great exercise, which can be done while pregnant (as long as your doctor or midwife is happy) is getting on all fours, lifting one leg out straight behind you and doing small pulses — ten to 20. Keep the back as flat as possible. Do the other side, then another set.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If you feel discomfort, especially around the pubic bone, stop.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another exercise is a chair squat. ‘Stand with your feet hip-width apart and move into a semi squat, as though you’re lowering into a chair. Hover hips at least an inch higher than the knees.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She points out that yoga (and Pilates) are both excellent for engaging the muscles in the abdomen, which also helps improve posture and to engage the glutes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Remember that your body is post-natal for up to two years,’ she adds. ‘It takes quite a long time to get back to normal — don’t put too much pressure on yourself.</p><img id=i-22f3b10fbe9ef36 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/19/01/11156714-6823983-Rachel_Weisz_pictured_with_Daniel_Craig-a-4_1552957481126.jpg height=655 width=305 alt="Rachel Weisz, pictured with Daniel Craig" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-e3d50059d8a765e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/18/21/11156716-6823983-image-m-51_1552946079680.jpg height=658 width=306 alt="She gave birth to their child last year aged 48" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Rachel Weisz, pictured with Daniel Craig (left), gave birth to their child last year aged 48&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>WALK BACK TO FITNESS</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>No one is saying new mothers ought to be pounding the pavements. ‘There is plenty of time to regain muscle tone, and it’s far more important that you rest when you can,’ says Mr Spence-Jones. But gentle exercise is a good idea, he adds.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Studies have shown that hours spent sitting, resting your weight on your bottom, means that fat cells thrive.
