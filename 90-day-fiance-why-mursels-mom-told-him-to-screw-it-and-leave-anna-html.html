But after a tense bachelorette party in which her friends questioned her fiance’s motives, Anna decided not to go forward with her wedding to Mursel unless he came clean about her family.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_25>On the Dec. 22 episode, “Judgement Day,” Anna and Mursel finally confronted their main relationship issue head-on…and the results were heartbreaking for both of them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AnnaCampisi90Day.png><h3>Anna gave Mursel an ultimatum about her three kids</h3><p id=par-4_26>At the beginning of their segment on “<a href=#>Judgement Day</a>,” Mursel admitted his relationship with Anna was suffering. “There is some tension,” he told TLC producers.</p><p id=par-5_64>“Anna told me she made a decision. She told me it was necessary we talked about the children to my family. If I don’t tell my family about Anna’s children, I think she won’t marry me. I am scared she will send me back to Turkey.” In an attempt to save his marriage, he had finally agreed to t<a href=#>ell his parents about Anna’s kids</a>.</p><p id=par-6_39>But the 90 Day Fiancé star was convinced the revelation wouldn’t go over well with his family. “Even though Anna will be happy about this, she will be really upset when she sees the reaction from them,” he lamented.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h3>Mursel’s parents urged him to return to Turkey</h3><p id=par-7_30>In an awkward video chat, Mursel finally told his parents the truth. “I have something to tell you,” he said straightforwardly as his mother waited patiently. “Anna has three children.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_14>Immediately, Mursel’s mom was horrified. “She took you for a fool!” she declared harshly.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_47>She went on to say she had never supported Mursel and Anna’s relationship to begin with. “I never wanted Anna. You always said you wanted her. I didn’t want her from the beginning, but I didn’t say anything because you would get mad,” Mursel’s mother told him.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_38>“Screw it. Come home. Leave her. Leave. You can’t deal with them,” she told the 90 Day Fiancé star. Instead, she urged her son to return to Turkey, cut all ties with Anna, and find a new job.</p><p id=par-11_53>Mursel was heartbroken, but didn’t say much on the call. However, he admitted to TLC producers that even he hadn’t expected that harsh of a reaction from his parents. “When my family reacted to Anna’s children, even I was surprised,” he said. “Before this phone call, they always expressed nice stuff about Anna.”</p><p id=par-12_18>“They perceived her as a bad woman. I mean incredibly bad,” the 90 Day Fiancé star confessed sadly.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><h3>Mursel called off his wedding to Anna</h3><p id=par-13_28>After Mursel’s conversation with his parents, Anna nervously asked her fiance what had happened. “They don’t want you,” <a href=#>Mursel told Anna</a>, folding over in despair onto the table.</p><p id=par-14_19>“So no marriage? Mursel?” Anna asked him, looking pale and distraught. He nodded as they both began to cry.</p><p id=par-15_18>“So what now?” Anna asked Mursel with a translation app as they broke down together on the couch.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_12>“I’m going to leave now,” Mursel told Anna, appearing shell-shocked and devastated.</p><p id=par-17_36>“I’m feeling pretty devastated,” Anna admitted to 90 Day Fiancé producers as tears ran down her cheeks. “This isn’t what I planned for. We love each other and we’ve invested all this time and money…it’s done.”</p><p id=par-18_7>“We ruined everything,” Mursel said finally.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSGcXnDmrBmnpmWu6SxjLCfsmWdqr%2B0scusZKannWLBsLjDZp%2BipV2pvG6%2FwqucsGWZqXqiusNmo56Zppp6orrNmmWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
