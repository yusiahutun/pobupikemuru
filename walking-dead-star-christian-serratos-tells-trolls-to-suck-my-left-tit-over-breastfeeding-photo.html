But why purposely draw.attention to it?" one user wrote. "Um why? At least show the tits more," another posted.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3f594620-677c-5863-82f5-d102dd57b13f data-container-ref=toofab:article:c9b47b63-6790-547e-b086-00c8c9a89219 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/68/5by4/2017/04/03/683d924aa32a5897885b7346b95e3e26_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">AMC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">4 OMG 'Walking Dead' Moments and 3 Burning Questions from Season Finale</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Just Cuz you can doesn't mean you should. Why would you want tens of millions of [strangers] to see this? Yes, anyone can and should do anything they want," read another comment. "[But] why would anyone want tens of millions of strangers and weirdos to see this?"</p><p>"No reason to post about this.

And if you do, I hope you teach them about kindness and acceptance," she wrote at the time.</p><p>"I hope they learn that it isn't ok to make fun of people or call people names. I hope one day YOU learn what it takes to be a parent. A kind, selfless parent. A working parent. A parent that puts themselves in someone else's shoes," she continues. "Maybe you can't get it through your thick f--king skull, but nursing a baby for a year (and pumping in a van between takes, in the dead of summer in Georgia) is a lot of work, determination, and scheduling."</p><p>"Also, grow the f--k up. Your mother should be ashamed for raising such a judgmental bully," she writes. "I'm sure she knows how 'courageous' you must be for trolling and hiding behind your Iphone and computers. P.s. I would LOVE to see any man or woman give birth to a baby, nurse the baby, and then work 17 hour days and NAIL their own stunts. P.s.s. Be kind to each other. We need it now more than ever."</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/eb/o/2017/04/03/eb1f7480aa46571e984fe595a7db0676_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7j3BmaW5frK6tt8innmaclZaxbr%2FTmqlmm5intrTAyJqlZquVp7%2BiwM6sZK2dnKHAbsDRqKOlq12pvG6%2F1JyiZqWpYrmmstNmq6KsXaTDpr6Mm6memaOps6axw6KloGWgnby1u44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
