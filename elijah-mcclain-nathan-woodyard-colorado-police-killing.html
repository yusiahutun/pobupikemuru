Woodyard had been suspended without pay for two years since he was indicted for his role in the death of the 23-year-old. An Aurora spokesperson said city law mandated that the department offer him his job back after his acquittal in the criminal trial, and that he would receive $212,546 to cover the salary from his leave.</p><figure id=2c3fa8bd-57ea-4e61-b717-6e6bde1bc576 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>Elijah McClain: one Colorado officer convicted and one acquitted in 2019 killingRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The killing of McClain, who became unconscious as he was held down by multiple officers and then was injected with a dangerously high dose of ketamine, sparked national outrage and years of protests. McClain was a massage therapist and animal lover who had taught himself to play violin.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Woodyard, one of three officers who have faced prosecution, is returning to his job despite playing a pivotal role in the initial stop of McClain and using force tactics that the local coroner’s office has ruled contributed to his death.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“[Woodyard] has elected to reintegrate with the APD and is currently on Restricted Duty (not in uniform, no public contact, and no enforcement actions) pending next steps in the reintegration process,” a city spokesperson, Ryan Luby, said in an email, adding that <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Aurora’s city charter</a> dictates that officers who face felony charges must be immediately suspended without pay until the case is resolved, and reinstated if they are acquitted.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>On 24 August 2019, McClain was walking home from buying iced tea at a convenience store and listening to music on headphones when a driver passing by called police, reporting that McClain “looks sketchy” and “might be a good person or a bad person”. McClain was wearing a ski mask, which he used to keep warm due to being anemic.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Although the 911 caller made clear that he did not see any weapons and that he was not in danger, nor was anyone else, police quickly responded with extreme force.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Woodyard was the first to confront McClain, body-camera footage <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">showed</a>, immediately grabbing him and shouting: “I have a right to stop you because you’re being suspicious.” Two other police officers, Randy Roedema and Jason Rosenblatt, soon arrived and with Woodyard surrounded him. McClain responded: “I’m an introvert. Please respect the boundaries that I’m speaking … I’m going home.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The three forced McClain to the ground and placed him in a neck hold, while putting their combined body weight on top of him. McClain said “I can’t breathe” at least <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">seven times</a>. He vomited and lost and regained consciousness. The officers claimed that McClain, who was 5ft 7in and 140lbs , had “incredible strength” and falsely alleged he was “on something”. Paramedics who arrived injected him with 500mg of ketamine, a sedative. McClain then suffered a heart attack and never awoke.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>McClain’s <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">final words</a> included pleas to the officers, saying: “I’m so sorry. I have no gun. I don’t do that stuff. I don’t do any fighting … I don’t even kill flies! I don’t eat meat … I respect all life … Forgive me! All I was trying to do was become better.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In the immediate aftermath, local officials claimed his cause of death could not be determined and that no charges would be filed, but after significant backlash, the coroner released a revised autopsy with the cause of death listed as “complications of ketamine administration following forcible restraint”. An independent investigation also <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">determined</a> police had no legal basis to stop McClain.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Woodyard <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">took the stand</a> in his trial and said he put McClain in a neck hold because he feared for his life. He cited the fact that during the initial struggle, Roedema had shouted “He just grabbed your gun” but there was no evidence McClain ever made contact with any of the officers’ weapons. Woodyard also cited the fact that McClain had said “I intend to take my power back” as he explained that he was listening to music and begged the officers to let him go.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><a data-ignore=global-link-styling href=# class=dcr-porppu>skip past newsletter promotion</a><p class=dcr-1w3z9oe>Sign up to <span>First Thing</span></p><span class=dcr-ld1976>Free daily newsletter</span><p class=dcr-k17n11>Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters</p><span class=dcr-10ejt2b><strong>Privacy Notice: </strong>Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rosenblatt was found not guilty in that case, but he was fired in 2020 when a release of text messages <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">revealed</a> that three officers sent him a joking selfie recreating the chokehold of McClain, and he replied: “ha ha.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Two paramedics, Jeremy Cooper and Peter Cichuniec, are also facing trial, charged with manslaughter and assault.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Woodyard is one of several officers across the country who have returned to the police force after being removed due to high-profile killings.
