Her passion for acting and theater began when she was just a teenager and developed into a <a href=#>tremendous career</a> as an Academy Award-winning star. Fans of the </span><i><span>Bird Box</span></i><span> actress may be shocked to learn five surprising facts about her.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The superstar, born in 1964 in Virginia, traveled all over the world with her family as a child. Her father, John W. Bullock, was a member of the U.S. Army and was stationed in Germany when he met Sandra’s mom, Helga Meyer. Helga toured Europe as an opera singer, later inspiring a passion for performing and entertainment in Sandra and her younger sister, </span><a href=#><b>Gesine Bullock-Prado</b></a><span>. The </span><i><span>Proposal</span></i><span> actress also speaks fluent German.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The </span><i><span>Gravity</span></i><span> star moved to New York after college to make her dreams of lighting up some of the world’s biggest stages come true. She earned a theater credit in 1988’s off-Broadway production of </span><i><span>No Time Flat</span></i><span>. Soon after, Sandra scored several minor film roles that would ultimately lead up to her big breakout performance in 1994’s </span><i><span>Speed</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She established a <a href=#>lasting friendship</a> with costar </span><a href=#><b>Keanu Reeves</b></a><span>. Despite their steamy connection onscreen, over the years, the pair have maintained that they were only ever just friends.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Keanu’s a guy who, I feel like, is friends with every woman he’s ever dated. I don’t think there’s anyone who has something horrible to say about him,” Sandra told </span><a href=#><i><span>Esquire</span></i></a><span> in November 2021. “So, maybe we could have survived. I don’t know. But we didn’t have to survive anything. We just get to grow up together on parallel roads and tip our hats, and meet for a dinner and try to work together. And the longer time goes on, the more in awe I am of the human being. Would I have been able to say that if he had dumped me and made me angry? Probably not.”</span></p><p><span>Sandra did find love with photographer </span><a href=#><b>Bryan Randall</b></a><span>, whom she <a href=#>began dating in 2015</a> after he was hired to take photos at <a href=#>her son</a> Louis’ birthday party. The Fortis Films founder is also a mom to daughter Laila, whom she also welcomed via adoption in 2015. Sandra loves spending time with <a href=#>her little ones</a> and her beau when she’s not filming the latest blockbuster.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I found the love of my life,” the </span><i><span>Crash</span></i><span> actress gushed during a December 2021 episode of </span><i><span>Red Table Talk</span></i><span>. “We share two beautiful children — three children, his older daughter. It’s the best thing ever.”</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to learn five surprising facts about Sandra.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smKecopZ6o8HLpaaco12brqTA0maYnKyimsC0ecSaqaWxXaG2p7GMn5imoZyueqWx05qgpatf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
