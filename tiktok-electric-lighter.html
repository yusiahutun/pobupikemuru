As I type this story, I have a holiday candle ablaze, a fresh cup of coffee in hand, and a small but mighty Christmas tree beside me.

With it, I can light my fave candle with the flick of a switch. It’s my most-used home <a href=# id=auto-tag_gadget data-tag=gadget>gadget</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok-viral product</a> thus far. And as shoppers say, they make for great small gifts or stocking stuffers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I bought one after falling to a TikTok recommendation. </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>I have now bought four</span></a><span> and I need one more. Passing them out as Christmas gifts like Oprah with car keys,” wrote one reviewer who gave this product a perfect rating.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>RELATED: </b><a href=# rel=noopener><b>14 Candles That Will Undoubtedly Get You Into The Holiday Spirit</b></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/reidea-electric-lighter.jpeg><p><span>Here’s how it works so well and why it’s better than your run-of-the-mill, gas station lighter. First, it never runs out of fuel. Simply plug it into an outlet with the included USB cable and you’ll have a long-lasting charge for days or even weeks. I’ve been using my lighter for a solid three weeks and have only plugged it in once, and not even because its charge died. (A blue light on the bottom of the gadget indicates charge and power levels).</span></p><p><span>Second, it’s a safer, less risky lighting option. The part that actually lights the candle remains hidden until you flip a non-slip switch up. Plus, the lighter </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>automatically turns off</span></a><span> after 10 seconds of being used. All of these safety features significantly slim down the chances of me potentially burning down my new apartment building.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Using a regular lighter or matches have become difficult when your candle is almost out and you end up burning yourself,” wrote another shopper. “</span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Absolutely love this gadget, s/o Tiktok</span></a><span>.”</span></p><p><span>If the convenience and safety of </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>REIDEA’s electric lighter</span></a><span> is right up your alley, then head on over to Amazon and order one for you and a few for the fam, too. While you’re at it, check out the candles I can’t stop sniffing this holiday season below.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/anthropologie-holiday-tin-candle-milk-and-cookies.jpeg><p><span>I’ve been obsessed with this candle for a few years now. There are Mulled Wine and Hot Buttered Rum scents, but I’m a die-hard </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Milk & Cookies</span></a><span> gal all the way. It truly does smell like freshly baked cookies, but it’s not too overpowering. I’m currently burning through last year’s version of the Holiday Candle Tin, since I stocked up big time and bought three for myself, plus another one as a gift (sorry, not sorry).&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/c-and-the-moon-sugar-cookie-candle.jpeg><p><span>This candle definitely hits the spot in terms of ones that smell just like </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>sugar cookies</span></a>. <span>It gives off a warm, gentle aroma that I often opt for when I want something a tad lighter than the Anthro candle above.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/capri-blue-iridescent-jar-candle-e1638913950864.jpeg><p><span>Everyone’s obsessed with </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Capri Blue’s candle in the Volcano scent</span></a><span>. I’m tempted to try it next, especially since it’s $10 off for a limited time only at Anthropologie. I usually don’t go for fruity candles, but tropical fruits, sugared oranges, and mountain greens kind of sounds like heaven to me.</span></p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$24 (originally $34)</span></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter-beauty_july2020.jpg alt="STYLECASTER | Ashley Benson Interview" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8eopJ5nYWeBcn2XcGatoZupvKx5xKWcnKyinrBuuMign62domQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
