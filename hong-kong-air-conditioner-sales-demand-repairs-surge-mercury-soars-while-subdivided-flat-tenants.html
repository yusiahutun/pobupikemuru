Her son is a Hong Kong permanent resident, but since he is under 18, he is not eligible for public housing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/03/b5f9632e-eea2-4d8e-81e2-8bf97327c3da_8304c1f2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She revealed she spent half of her HK$6,000 (US$766) per month in government subsidies on rent, leaving little for food, transport and utility bills.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are very nervous about turning on the air conditioner because we don’t know how much money it racks up,” Wong said. “In the summer, I turn it on at around 10pm before bed, and turn it off at 4am, but the home heats up very quickly.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the day, while her son is at school, Wong stays out of the flat as much as possible.
