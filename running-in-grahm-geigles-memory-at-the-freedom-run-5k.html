Some people specifically used the occasion to remember a local veteran who died Monday. Their shirts say ‘Running for Grahm’ and ‘Team Geigle,’ honoring their friend Grahm Geigle who died this week.
“This was one of Grahm’s favorite races,” said Anna Raya, one of Grahm’s running teammates."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He was an athlete in high school, but said his desire to serve his country took center stage.</p><p>“Right out of high school, I joined boot camp. &nbsp;I went to the Navy. &nbsp;I was a jet mechanic. I loved every minute of it,” Geigle told Local 4 News in an interview from February, 2014.</p>Geigle was living his dream, but when he was hurt in a car accident, active duty just wasn’t in the cards anymore. He moved home for a job at the Rock Island Arsenal and picked up running. Soon, he was running event after event, even joining the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Live Uncommon</a> race team to start raising money for his favorite veteran’s charities.<p>“As I was asked: what’s your charity going to be, I was like (snaps fingers) Wounded Warrior Project. &nbsp;I didn’t even have to think about it,” Geigle said in 2014.</p><p>For Geigle, running was never about being fast; it was about giving back. That’s why his friends started at the back of the pack at the Freedom Run 5K Thursday night; representing his charities of choice and remembering the mark Geigle left on their lives.</p><p>“It’s kind of, you know, upsetting, but at the same time exciting and happy because we’re running it in his honor and I know he’d be happy. This was basically home to him,” said Raya.</p>You can donate to Grahm’s family via GoFundMe by clicking&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here </a>or copying & pasting this link into your browser:&nbsp;https://www.gofundme.com/ripgrahmgeigle<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46rrKemmaO0brXNZp6rmZiieqixyKCjnqtdorKuu9GyZJqsXam1pnnFq5yenJ%2BierPBzWZspGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
