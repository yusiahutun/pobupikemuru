If they’re feeling so body-conscious, the way I was — they can do what they need to do to feel better.”</span></p><p><span>The ABC News correspondent admitted that she realized her body changed a lot after giving birth to her kids, Gabriel and Paloma, whom she shares with her husband, </span><b>Emmanuel Hostin</b><span>. During her early days on </span><i><span>The View</span></i><span>, Sunny wore a binder or a minimizer bra to help her clothes fit her chest area. She confessed that she had a few emotional moments before red carpet events regarding her wardrobe not fitting properly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After years of making special adjustments to her garments, the New York native decided to look into a number of procedures. She shared her plastic surgery journey five months post-op in the hopes of inspiring others to do what makes them happy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I look through magazines and Instagram accounts. I always believed, ‘Oh, they must be clean eating.’ No, they’re not — a lot of them are taking something, or they’re getting plastic surgery,” she said. “It’s their decision to keep it private. But I wanted to be really honest. And I’m so happy.”</span></p><p><span>This isn’t the first time the </span><i><span>Girls Trip </span></i><span>actress has gotten candid about her body on a public platform. Sunny became a permanent cohost on </span><i><span>The View</span></i><span> in 2016 for season 20 after serving as a legal analyst on Fox News. After a viewer questioned whether Sunny had weight loss surgery, the TV host took to Twitter to share the reason why she looked different.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I’ve lost some weight but not because of the work — I’ve stopped eating sugar and meat,” she wrote in a March 2016 tweet.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Fans have long admired her honesty whether it’s on the long-running talk show or on social media.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see photos of Sunny’s plastic surgery transformation.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46srKemqWK1sL%2FToqVmqJyWwLW1wmaqrqqXmr%2B6ec%2Bhpq2no2LBqbGMr6Cer12dvLTA0manopukqr%2Bmv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
