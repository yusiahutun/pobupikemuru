It's probably good news for all his lady fans.</p><p>However, rumors <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">have&nbsp;been surfacing around that Munro is a gay</a>, but no verification&nbsp;has been made. But a Degrassi <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">source has stated</a>:</p><p>No,Munro chambers is not gay,although,there are many rumors and fake pages saying he is and is openly gay.But has said nothing on camera of film to prove it.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=182 style="float:none!important;margin-top:50px!important;display:block!important;min-width:580px;margin-left:auto!important;text-align:center!important;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:970px;margin-bottom:50px!important;max-width:970px;margin-right:auto!important;min-height:400px;line-height:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important"></span>He may be single as of now, but he has experienced relationships with celebrities and co-stars in the past, which we will soon be revealing.</p><p>Responding to an interview question in 2011,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chambers said</a>&nbsp;: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I am currently where I am. I’m dating Justin Kelly! We’re engaged and we’re going to the Bahamas for the honeymoon! It’ll be great. [Laughs] I’m currently in love with my work. I’m dating her.</p><p>Justin Kelly is the best friend of Chambers, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">both were Degrassi cast members</a>. It has been mentioned that Munro along with Justin and some other friends have created a fake family: An Italian Mafia Family. Furthermore, the comment mentioned above "I am dating Justin Kelly" is something he must have said jokingly. He even added,"&nbsp;I’m currently in love with my work. I’m dating her."</p><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=181 style="min-height:400px;line-height:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;width:970px;margin-top:15px!important;min-width:970px;max-width:970px;padding:0;float:none!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;text-align:center!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-left:auto!important"></span><strong>Caption: Munro Chambers and Annie Clark.

However, nothing regarding their relation has been mentioned anywhere.

Even before that, there were rumors that Chambers dated Alicia Josipovic. Then later after Morgan,&nbsp;Chambers dated Melinda Shankar in 2013. This third relationship could barely last six months.

Actually, the news was publicly announced by Kendra in one of the Birthday Bash events. Let’s see what she said <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">to the interviewers during Luke Bilyk’s $80 birthday bash</a> &nbsp;in 2011:</p><p>To be honest, I introduced myself to Munro about a year ago, but I knew Spinner would be an overly protective older brother, but that’s just who he is. He threatened Toby Isaacs back in Season 2 but that was a much different time. &nbsp;Munro is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;not the same&nbsp;kind of person. His hands are gold-worthy. His smirk is candy. His charm is to DIE! For and his body is a wonderland. OMFG every time he tweets I want Munro to be in my Chambers…like not even kidding.</p><p>Eventually, after situation went wrong because of some jealous fangirls bashing her, Kendra vanished from the party without giving the proper explanation. Also, since Chambers has mentioned nothing about it, there was nothing verifiable to say they got engaged. She must have made this statement on her own. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-630 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=630 style="margin-right:auto!important;min-width:250px;min-height:400px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;max-width:970px;line-height:0;float:none!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;text-align:center!important;padding:0;width:970px"></span></p><p>Furthermore, you will love to see this tweet where Munro and his previous girlfriends, both real and rumored&nbsp;are posing together:</p><p dir=ltr lang=und>Tbt! <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@JessicaTyler</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@AJSaudin</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@lukebilyk1</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@_samanthamunro</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@The_Munro</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@anniejclark</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@AliciaJosipovic</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@melindashankar</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/AVBufLOjqo</a> — Jenn♥ (@JessTylerFeels) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">February 6, 2014</a></p><h2>Munro's Short Bio:</h2><p>Born on July 29,1990, in Ajax,&nbsp;Canada,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Munro Chambers</a> attended Newmarket High School in Ontario.
