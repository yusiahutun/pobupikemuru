Not only is this adorable little electric griddle the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">No. 1 bestseller</a> in the retailer’s launchpad category, which showcases ambitious startups and their products, it boasts more than 3,000 — yes, 3,000— 5-star reviews from verified purchasers. That’s a lot of happy waffle consumers!&nbsp;</p><p>Plenty sets this compact food maker apart from the pack. For starters, it’s super fast! With a 4-inch, non-stick surface that cooks a waffle in three minutes or less after being plugged in, the Dash Mini Maker is ideal for those days you’re running late but still need to <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">grab a quick bite</a>. “It makes a waffle in about two minutes,” one reviewer wrote, adding, “About the time it takes to make my coffee.”</p><p>Then, there’s the convenience factor. Weighing in at just over a pound and fitting in the palm of your hand, you can store this little beauty in even the smallest of spaces or take it along wherever you go, be it <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">camping</a>, <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">off to college</a>, or even on your travels.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll also be reducing waste with use, since 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter is all you’ll need to get started on making personal, Eggo-sized light and fluffy waffles for your daily enjoyment. “The waffles look like an Eggo, but they are oh-so-much better,” one reviewer exclaimed. “Definitely, depending on the batter, as good or better than any at a pancake shop.”&nbsp;</p><p>This is likely due to the waffle maker’s temperature-regulated heating element, which automatically turns on and off while cooking to ensure that the surface is never too cold or too hot.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/dash-mini-heart-waffle-maker.jpg><p class=caption style=text-align:center>Amazon</p><p>Dash’s Mini Maker is also plenty versatile, with waffles being the tip of the iceberg of items that can be whipped up with this handy device. It comes with a book full of recipes as well as a recipe database full of tips for cooking everything from breakfast sandwiches and hash browns to quesadillas and crab cakes. &nbsp;</p><p>“At first, I laughed [because] thought it was too small to really do anything,” one reviewer admitted. “I was so wrong, it’s an amazing little waffle maker!! [I] can cook almost anything on it! I have cooked eggs, waffles, and French toast.”&nbsp;</p><p>And once you’ve breezed through your perfect meal? Simply clean the non-stick surface for your next use — a task reviewers say is a breeze. “The non-stick surface really is nonstick. Kind of critical with a waffle maker, so the waffles come off clean without scraping and scrubbing.”&nbsp;</p><p>Prices range by color and shape (several models produce <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pumpkin</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">heart-shaped</a> waffles), but each one comes with a one-year manufacturer’s warranty, so you won’t have to worry about it breaking down after a few uses.&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t know about you, but we’re suddenly craving waffles something fierce!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where to buy: $9.99 to $14.99, </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Amazon</strong></a></p><p>See more of our <a href=#><u>best product recommendations</u></a>.</p><p>We write about products we think our readers will like.
