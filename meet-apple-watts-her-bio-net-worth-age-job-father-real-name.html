But, one particular comment during the podcast ruined everything for her. While speaking about her relationship with rapper Moneybagg Yo she shared, “Like, pull your gun out and show me like, ‘b*tch leave. I wish you would walk out the door.'” She received backlashes for the gun comments and she later took to IG live to address the backlash.</p><p>In Instagram Live, Ari denied acknowledging people’s domestic violence stories and uttered ‘nobody cares’ repeatedly. She emphasized that she doesn’t care because people were trying to play the victim.</p><p>However, this enflamed the fans even more.</p><p>One of the notable personalities who commented was Apple Watts AKA Jontelle Lafaye Watts. “Why you gotta be so stuck up? You’re like a tampon so stuck up. We get it, you’ve got money,” she commented for calling “doesn’t care” about people’s domestic violence stories. “You need to humble yourself. You talk too much on the internet. And then you want to downgrade b*tches that got beat up by domestic violence”.</p><p>Apple challenged people further that they can troll her page all day long and talk about her all day long still, she does not condone domestic violence. No response came from Ari at the time of this writing and both of them have disabled their IG profiles.</p><h3><strong>What Does Apple Watts Do For A Living?</strong></h3><p>Apple Watts is a rapper, urban model, and video vixen. But, VH1’s ‘Love and Hip Hop’ added more to her fame after she joined the show as a supporting cast in season five. Her IMDB revealed she appeared in 29 episodes of the show.</p><p>According to Love And Hip Hop Fandom, Apple rose to fame as a stripper and also indulged herself in pornography under the name Ms. Apple Bottom. She indulged in stripping at the age of 21. This even got her to indulge with hip-hop stars like Snoop Dogg, Chris Brown, YG, and Frank Ocean.</p><p>It allowed her to model in the videos. Apple explained during an interview, “I did a lot of videos and I was just shaking my booty. Because booty is important.” While she earned recognition for dancing, it affected her career as an aspiring hip-hop artist. She revealed, “It was hard for me to get into the game because I’m a woman and a dancer. [Producers and talent] don’t wake a woman seriously — unless you about to smash somebody or something, and that’s not about to pop off.”</p><p>Apple revealed that she was tired of stripping and tried breaking into hip hop and as a reality star. She is discoverable on Spotify and SoundCloud and still lacks a proper body of work to push her rapping career.</p><p>Other than that, Apple also has an OnlyFans account (<a href=#>@applewatts1</a>). She charges $35 for a 1-month subscription and $89.25 for a 3-month subscription.</p><p>Her Facebook stated that she studied Criminal Justice at El Camino College.</p><p>Apple is a business owner who founded the company Apple Drip Clothing LLC in August 2020.</p><h3><strong>Apple Watts Net Worth</strong></h3><p>As of December 2021, Apple Watts should have a net worth of not more than $600 thousand.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Apple Watts?</strong></h3><p>Born on 16 May 1985, Apple Watts turned 36 years old in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Apple Watts Real Name</strong></h3><p>The real name of Apple Watts is Jontelle Lafaye Watts.</p><h3><strong>Apple Watts Height</strong></h3><p>Speaking of her height, Apple stands tall at 5 feet 6.5 inches.</p><h3><strong>Is Apple Watts In A Relationship?</strong></h3><p>Currently, influencer Apple Watts’s relationship remains uncertain. She hid her love life away from the fans and now that she has deactivated her main IG account, it proved almost impossible to deduce her relationship status even more. But, in March 2021, Apple shared a clip of herself passionately kissing a young guy.</p><p>She captioned the post, “Relationships goals my ass, We make our own stories through the fight, the arguments, the mistrust, the love, the tears, the pain, ppl paint a good picture on the internet like they relationship is perfect and people always want relationship goals but people won’t post that their husband beat them are they boyfriend cheated on them or he got another person pregnant”.</p><p>Apple ended the post, “so when y’all post relationship goals of what other ppl relationships￼ u think are, ppl fake for the internet all the time just because it glitters doesn’t mean it’s gold ..remember this …relationship takes time patience, trust, pain and more I don’t want to be nobody else relationship goals I wanna make my own goals. Period”.</p><p>Back in 2018, Apple got cozy with a guy named Maurice but not many details are known about the relationship. She introduced her ex-boyfriend with an IG caption, “Some of these men are not future material they just have something to occupy your time when you are lonely”.</p><p>Furthermore, Apple Watts is a mother of three children; Richard, Kali, and Miyaki Watts.
