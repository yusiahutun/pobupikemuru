This is where things imploded on the video app.</p><p>Most fans of the celebrity can probably imagine him saying ‘Mister Lover’ in their head, but it wasn’t his. Nope.</p><p>Shaggy admitted he picked up the voice he uses in his famous songs from his army days, and it’s not his real one he uses day to day. Real name Orville Richard Burrell CD, he moved to New York City at 18 in the late 80s, and later enlisted in the US Marine Corps. He found the voice he wanted to use for his music by “mocking drill instructors in the military”.</p><p>In the video, he explained how he went about it, while putting on the voice once again – that fans know.</p><p>He said: “In the Marines the drill instructors would go ‘yeah boy drop and give it 20, let’s go boy’.</p><p>“I just sang that song in that voice because it sounded cool.”</p><p>The celebrity admits he’d have to use that voice in his other songs because that’s how people recognized him. But he sounds different in his earlier hits, but they didn’t storm the charts like his biggest songs did.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-can-t-compute>‘I can’t compute’</h2><p>Fans can’t seem to wrap their heads around it, after seeing Shaggy speaking with his real voice in the clip.</p><p>One wrote on Reddit: “I’m not exaggerating or anything, but this is a serious flabbergasted moment for me. I lived my entire life thinking this man was Jamaican and Mr. Lova Lova was his natural accent.</p><p>“Why is he talking like good ol’ regular Frank in the video? I legit can’t compute lol.”</p><p>A second declared: Excuse me! My whole childhood was a lie!”</p><p>While on TikTok, fans were just as confused.</p><p>Someone penned: “So we all just hearing Shaggy’s real voice for the first time?”</p><p>“That’s Shaggy’s government voice?” asked another, before one user joked: “Not Shaggy gas lighting us all these years”.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2Z%2FcL%2FHmp6gsaNiv6aty2atqKGTmnqistOeqWZrYGLGpq3RrGStqpmctKa%2B0madmqajYrq6ecKhoKWcmKS8pXnWmqpmmV2htqZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
