I think we should abolish the rule. Students should have the right to choose their own hairstyle, just like teachers can choose their dress and wear their own hairstyle. It’s a way for teenagers to boost their self-esteem, not to mention that well-groomed students give the school a positive image.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Some students want the right to have fashionable hairstyles.

School uniforms can be expensive, depending on the quality of the fabric and workmanship. Since a student goes to school five days a week, they need at least two to three sets of clothes, and this could be a financial burden for some families. Furthermore, since teachers have the right to choose what they wear to school, students should be given the same right to make their own choice – not to mention that students could boost their self-confidence by wearing clothes they enjoy.</span></p><p><h3 type=h3><strong type=strong><span type=text>Paco Tsang Pak-ho, 13, Lok Sin Tong Wong Chung Ming Secondary School</span></strong></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>My schools has a spectacle frames policy that bans thick temples, large logos or trendy symbols from our eyeglasses. This limits the styles that students can wear to school. But I can see my teacher’s spectacle frames are very different. Some are plastic and colourful, while some are silver and stainless steel.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>I think this is discrimination. It is not fair that students need to stick to rules while teachers can enjoy their freedom. Campus life is like a small society, so we must be fair and just.</span></p><p><h3 type=h3><strong type=strong><span type=text>Natalie Tang Tsz-yan, 14, Tak Oi Secondary</span></strong></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>If I could get rid of a school rule, it would be the restriction on using mobile phones on our school campus. Mobile phones are more affordable than iPads. Every student has a mobile phone of their own, and they can use them to record lectures so they can recall lessons quickly and easily. Not only is it a device for communication, but it is also a tool for learning.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Students should also be allowed to play games and watch news updates on their mobile phones during recess.

They are not allowed to leave campus for lunch. I think this is a peculiar request. Schools should respect students’ preferences, whether they choose to have lunch in school or off campus.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Junior secondary students are mature enough to take care of themselves. Also, they need time to develop their social skills, and lunch hour is the best time to do so. Restricting them to staying on their school campus all day long could be counterproductive to their emotional development.</span></p><p><h3 type=h3><strong type=strong><span type=text>Clara Lu, 18, Chinese International School</span></strong></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Rules are in place for a reason. However, there are some I don’t quite understand. For example, when I was in middle school, we were not allowed to use phones in the hallway. However, sometimes I urgently had to call my parents about family matters. Perhaps that rule could have been altered to make some exceptions.</span></p><p><h3 type=h3><strong type=strong><span type=text>Melody Ma Jing-mao, 15, Carmel Pak U Secondary School</span></strong></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>One of our school rules doesn’t allow us to borrow textbooks from one another.

In the summer heat, I understand that teachers want to have the lift for themselves – they wouldn’t want to share it with a lot of students. But there is a solution to the problem. There could be one lift for students and another one for teachers and people with injuries. This way, lifts would also be less crowded.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Many schools in Hong Kong do not allow their students to use the lifts.

At the moment, my tutoring room at school is also the textiles room, which is always locked because of our school rules. I get to school early in the morning and I used to sleep in my previous tutoring room, because I don’t sleep enough at night. However, due to this rule, I cannot get into the room to sleep, so I need to find somewhere to hang out before class starts.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxrF7w6KqnKemmr9wxc6uqWaun56wpnvAq6uim5yafHR9k3BsaXBfqbyxeZBpZKCdpKm2r7OMq6CdZZ%2Bjsm6%2B1KWcZrGfqr9uv8KhpqikXay1qq%2FHZqannQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
