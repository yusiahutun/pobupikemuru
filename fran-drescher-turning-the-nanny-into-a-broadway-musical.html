Well the assumption is that this meant some sort of reboot for television, but it’s been announced exactly&nbsp;what she was referring to:&nbsp;The Nanny&nbsp;is being turned into a Broadway musical. And the good news is that the show’s book will be written by Fran and series co-creator <strong>Peter Marc Jacobson</strong>. On top of that, <strong>Rachel Bloom</strong> and <strong>Adam Schlesinger</strong> of&nbsp;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&nbsp;are writing the music.</p><p>In a statement, Fran and Peter commented, “We are so excited to be working on the Broadway musical&nbsp;The Nanny. We’re equally excited that the wildly talented Rachel Bloom will be writing the lyrics and music with the fantastic Adam Schlesinger, and to have the brilliant <strong>Marc Bruni</strong> directing. Nobody is cast yet — we’re plotting — but we feel confident we will find a fabulous actress who is funny, charming and has a great voice.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fran-drescher.jpg><p>For her part, Bloom adds, “The Nanny was a fundamental part of my childhood, because it was the first time I saw an openly Jewish female protagonist on television. The story of Fran Fine, however, is a universal one that has touched the hearts of people of every race, religion and orientation. I am so proud to be using the characters established by The Nanny to tell a new story about one woman’s journey to becoming proud of who she is and what makes her different.”</p><p>Referring to&nbsp;The Sound of Music,&nbsp;director Marc Bruni explained, “The Nanny television series began from a familiar theatrical premise — but what if instead of Maria Rainer with her guitar, Fran Fine showed up on the doorstep of a fractured family? Over its six seasons, the show examined class, coming of age, feminism, love and Broadway with heart and laughs. I am thrilled to be working with Fran, Peter, Rachel, and Adam in bringing these characters to the stage in a fresh new light that I hope will delight fans of the show, as well as capture the imagination of a new generation of theatre-goers.”</p><p>In our conversation with Fran, she was asked&nbsp;why&nbsp;the show remains so popular over 10 years after it finished its network run. “It’s a real interesting question,” she replied. “I think it’s a very likable character and a very lovable character, but also great eye candy. It’s that&nbsp;<i>Upstairs/Downstairs,&nbsp;</i>blue collar meets blue blood relationship sprinkled with sexual tension. It’s an immature grownup acting more like a kid sometimes than the kids. And it’s all wrapped up in a very traditional silhouette, very much like <a href=#><i>The Sound of Music</i></a> — only, instead of&nbsp;<a href=#>Julie Andrews</a>,&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;</i>come to the door.”</p><p>And while you’re waiting for&nbsp;The Nanny&nbsp;to come to Broadway, you can check out the first two seasons of the original show for free on The Roku Channel, available on all Roku devices.
