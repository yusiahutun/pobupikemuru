See the full song and lyrics to "Give Her That" below.</p><p>"Give Her That&nbsp;describes a woman reminding a man of all the things he gave her first. The chorus refers to&nbsp;his mama's necklace and "wild summer nights where I learned all your secrets," and then an&nbsp;"Old school Skynyrd tee that I still sleep in."&nbsp;</p><p>Underwood, David Garcia and Lydia Vaughn wrote "Give Her That." The mother of two is no longer smashing headlights and carving up leather seats. Instead, she's planting a seed of poison in the mind of a man who did her wrong, then stepping back to watch it sprout.</p><p>The other three unreleased songs from the deluxe album are "Drunk and Hungover," "Damage" and "She Don't Know" (live from the Denim & Rhinestones Tour).</p><h3>Carrie Underwood, "Give Her That" Lyrics:</h3><p>She's beautiful / Looks good in a sundress hangin' on your arm / She's champagne sweet / A Covergirl face full of southern bell charm / I Can't deny it / She's got a lot of things that I'll never have / And that's a fact / She's probably perfect in every way / I'll give her that / But you can't give her that …</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>Old school Skynyrd tee that I still sleep in / Your mama's necklace, 'cause she wanted me to keep it / Every kiss, every minute that you spent on me / Every memory, you can't give her those / Wild summer nights where I learned all your secrets / Those I love yous that already fell off your lips / That part of your heart that you gave me and you can't get back / You can't give her that.</p><p>Red roses / You can leave 'em on the counter for her when she gets home / Give her that left side of your bed / House key and a top drawer of her own / I Can't deny it / She's got a lot of things that I'll never have / And that's a fact / Evan a diamond / Slide it on her hand / Go on and give her that / But you can't give her that …</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><p>She has your future and your attention / I got the you that she don't know she's missing / Yeah, there's a few things that she's never getting / You can't give her that.</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><h2 class=photogallery-title>35 Great Country Cheating Songs, Ranked</h2><p>When your partner's not being faithful — or when you're the one doing the cheating — country music has the perfect song for you.
