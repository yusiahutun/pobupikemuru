For years, I’ve been searching for the best voluminous mascara — one that’ll make my lashes seem miles long, but also doesn’t look clumpy and won’t rub off midday. Working in editorial, I’ve been lucky enough to test out tons: pricey options gifted to me by beauty editors, drugstore buys that I’m still a big fan of, etc."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I loved it so much that I used it all up, then threw down $30 for the full tube.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Normally, that price would seem pretty steep for me, especially since I’m more of a fashion lover than someone who splurges on luxury beauty. But I’ve never loved my lashes more than when I’m wearing this product. I apply two quick coats on each side and then — bam! — my eyelashes basically look fake.</p><p>Part of the draw is that this Lancôme mascara checks every box. The formula is advertised as one that will give wearers up “12x more volume” while also adding length, and it does seem to live up to that promise (although, I’m not actually measuring). There’s also the fact that it’s smudge-proof and flake-free, lasting up to 24 hours. It’s one of the only mascaras I’ve used where I don’t feel like I’m channeling a raccoon at the end of the day. My makeup looks just as good at 8 p.m. as it does at 8 a.m.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lancomemascarareview.jpg><p>The only criticism I have is about the brush. It’s on the thicker side and has wavy fiber bristles, which make it a bit harder to separate my lashes. Typically, I’ll go over them with a thinner, slightly curved brush I’ve held onto from a different tube, and am currently debating ordering an <a data-pmc-sp-product=6b5963dd125d178b4c27cc9994507742 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"eyelash comb","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Eyelash Separator Eyelash Comb Lash Separator Tool MSQ Mascara Brush Eyelash Brush Separator Mascara Comb Arc Designed Mascara Applicator With Cover Naked Pink (1PCS)","price":"4.79","id":"B0B5R95SDC","category":"Mascara Brushes"},"id":1695604,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>eyelash comb</a> to help even everything out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lancome-Mascara-Brush.jpg><p>Still, I’m not the only one who loves <a data-pmc-sp-product=4b2df22434f5499c50672ecc6a1696c3 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Monsieur Big mascara","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Lanc\u00f4me Monsieur Big Volumizing Mascara - Up To 12x More Volume & 24H Wear - False Lash Effect - Black","price":"30.00","id":"B071JQWDF2","category":"Mascara"},"id":1695604,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Monsieur Big mascara</a> . It currently boasts 4.4 stars on Amazon and has over 4,000 reviews, most of which are positive.</p><p>“This is my favorite mascara,” writes a happy customer. “Only a few layers and it makes my eyelashes nice and big. It also removes easily and doesn’t leave a lot of residue after washing my face.”</p><p>Even those who have lighter-colored lashes can’t help but sing this product’s praises.</p><p>“This has a thick rich color with a lot of adhesion to the lashes,” reads another review. “I have white eyelashes and you would not know by using this. It is easy to remove with an oil-based remover.”</p><p>Many also agree with me and add that mascara makes their eyelashes look fake.</p><p>“Received so many compliments!!!” one person says. “Lots of people asked who did my lashes!!! Great buy!”</p><p>While I’m personally all about the full-sized version (0.34 Fl Oz), you do have the option of buying <a data-pmc-sp-product=4c066f9d341f07c909a96057a1552531 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"a smaller one","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Lanc\u00f4me Monsieur Big Volumizing Mascara - Up To 12x More Volume & 24H Wear - False Lash Effect - Black - Travel Size","price":"16.00","id":"B074G4J1KK","category":"Mascara"},"id":1695604,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>a smaller one</a> (0.14 Fl Oz) for $16.
