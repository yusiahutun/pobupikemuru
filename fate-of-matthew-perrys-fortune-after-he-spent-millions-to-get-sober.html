But if not, it’s said his estate will go to his next of kin. In this case, both his biological parents, John Bennett Perry and Suzanne Perry will receive half each.</p><p>The star was reportedly planning to start a foundation for substance abuse treatment before his death, PEOPLE <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> on Monday. It’s said he wanted to help others overcome drug and alcohol dependency, as he was a recovering addict.</p><p>He had previously established Perry House, which was a man’s sober living society, from 2013-2015.</p><p>Lovell told Entertainment Tonight that it’s very possible Matthew had something set up that meant some parts of his estate could go to charities like these.</p><p>“Recovery was a big part of his life. He’d spent millions of dollars to pursue his own recovery, and I’m sure that had a personal effect on him,” Lovell shared. “I think it’s very likely… because he was very involved himself.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-wanted-to-be-remembered-for-helping-other-people>The star wanted to be remembered for ‘helping other people’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-106720225-1024x799.jpg><p>Although the star will be remembered for his iconic role as Chandler Bing, Matthew revealed he wanted to be remembered for <a href=#>more than just Friends</a>.</p><p>Speaking to Tom Power, on the Q podcast less than a year before his tragic death, Perry said he wanted to be remembered for how he helped others.</p><p>“When I die, I don’t want Friends to be the first thing that’s mentioned. I want that to be the first thing that’s mentioned. And I’m gonna live the rest of my life proving that,” he explained.</p><p>After the news of his death, a former co-star shared the <a href=#>final texts she shared with Matthew Perry</a>. The two had a sweet exchange only a matter of days before he was tragically found dead.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2V%2BcLLArZxmp5ZiuqLA06GcsGWgmr%2BzxdJmnaiqpKq7pnnAn6ueql2dsm6%2Fz56lrWWdnrmttc6nqmasn2K0psCMrKabnaJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
