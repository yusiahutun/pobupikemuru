They couldn't keep their hands off each other," a source at the club told Page Six of Miley and Kaitlynn. "They were kissing and making out everywhere. In the bathroom, at the bar, in the middle of the floor."</p><p>"They were basically having sex," the insider continued. "There's no question they're together."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>It all began when Kaitlynn and Miley, who are long-time friends, were photographed kissing while <a href=#><strong>on a girls trip to Italy</strong></a> earlier this month. The PDA came just a couple of weeks after news broke Kaitlynn and <a href=#><strong>Brody Jenner</strong></a> had split a little over a year after their wedding. It was also revealed the couple was never legally married.</p><p>One day after the makeout pics went public, a rep for Miley announced the singer and Liam had called it quits, after less than a year of marriage.</p><p>"Liam and Miley have agreed to separate at this time," the statement read. "Ever-evolving, changing as partners and individuals, they have decided this is what's best while they both focus on themselves and careers."</p><p>"They still remain dedicated parents to all of their animals they share while lovingly taking this time apart," the statement continued. "Please respect their process and privacy."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>To muddy the waters further, Brody commented on a picture shared by Kaitlynn of her and Miley in their bikinis. "Hot girl summer," he wrote of his ex and the girl his ex was just spotted making out with.</p><p>Although he initially seemed to mock Kaitlynn's behavior following their split with his Instagram comments, a few days later, Brody took to Instagram in an attempt to "set the story straight" about where the two stand now.</p><p>"There is far too much negativity being directed at someone who I love and care about very much," he wrote in a <a href=#><strong>note</strong></a>. "I feel the need to set the story straight. Kaitlynn and I have been best friends for 6 years, and we continue to be. We, like many others before us and many after us, grew in different directions over those same 6 years."</p><p>"Kaitlynn is a wonderful person, beautiful and fun to be with, always a positive force in my life," he continued. "We decided the best move for both of us was to keep our love for each other strong but move forward separately with our lives. I respect Kaitlynn and care deeply about her. She deserves to be able to move forward in her life with respect and happiness."</p><p>In the comments, Kaitlynn was one of the first to respond, leaving a heart emoji.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
