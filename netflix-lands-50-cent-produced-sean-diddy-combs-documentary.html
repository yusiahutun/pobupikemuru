NETFLIX wins the bidding war but if more victims keep coming out 🤷🏽‍♂️I’m gonna need more episodes. 😳<a href=#>https://t.co/jnbpt4VX0B</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5FHiTFrnQG</a></p><p>— 50cent (@50cent) <a href=#>May 22, 2024</a></p><p>First reported by TMZ, 50 Cent confirmed via social media that Netflix has purchased the documentary, produced by G-Unit Film and TV Studios. 50 Cent has been highly vocal on social media, frequently commenting on the allegations against the shamed rapper since a civil lawsuit was filed by Cassie Ventura, Comb’s former girlfriend, in November 2023. Some comments on X include:</p><p><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><strong>May 13</strong> – “I really don’t understand why they want to drug women, </span><img title="Man shrugging" draggable=false src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f937-1f3fd-200d-2642-fe0f.svg alt=🤷🏽‍♂️ width=18 height=18 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">if she can’t remember how good it was the next morning </span><img title="Flushed face" draggable=false src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f633.svg alt=😳 width=18 height=18 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">How do you connect?”</span></p><p><strong>May 17</strong> – “<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Now I’m sure puffy didn’t do it, he is innocent this proves nothing! This is what his lawyers are gonna say, God help us all.”</span></p><p>The announcement’s timing comes on the heels of yet another lawsuit filed this week. Model Crystal McKinley filed after the 2016 footage of Combs assaulting Ventura surfaced via CNN. McKinley alleges she was drugged and raped in 2003. In the filing, obtained by <a href=#><span>Digital Music News</span></a>, McKinley claims she was a model at Men’s Fashion Week in New York City, where she met Combs. He invited her back to his studio where Combs and several others were drinking Hennessy and smoking joints, suspecting the weed was laced with “a narcotic or other drug” as it was “very powerful.” She says Combs made her follow him to the bathroom, where he physically attempted to push her into oral sex. She said she lost consciousness and woke up later in a taxi, realizing she had been sexually assaulted.</p><p>A rep for 50 Cent and his film studio, G-Unit Film and Television Studios, told&nbsp;ET, “I can confirm that the untitled Diddy documentary is in development through G-Unit Film and Television with Curtis ’50 Cent’ Jackson serving as Executive Producer. Proceeds from this documentary that G-Unit Film and Television receive will go to victims of sexual assault and rape.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJRoaWxnnprBp7jIsWSlmZ6ZwG6Bj2aanqakYr2zu8Oump6cXaiyorqMnaCdnKlisLC5waxknaeTqrqmutOaqbJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
