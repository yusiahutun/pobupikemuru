They haven’t had the smoothest of relationships, sparking split speculations in 2023 when <a href=#>Megan Fox</a> posted a ‘cryptic message’ and removed herself from social media.

I can’t say for sure what the capacity will be but I will always be connected to him somehow.”</p><p>The actress then said she was “not willing to explain” beyond that which she says may be confusing for some people.</p><p>Megan recently released her poetry book, Pretty Boys Are Poisonous, which spoke about many of her relationships, including MGK. The Jennifer’s Body star admitted some of her poems were ‘savage’. There were also many emotional moments in the relationship, including a <a href=#>miscarriage the couple went through</a>.</p><p>“I didn’t really write anything about him that he hasn’t said about himself in his own <a href=#>music</a>, however, that doesn’t make it any less sensitive for him to experience me writing about it,” she said, explaining that it “felt different” and “wasn’t easy for him.”</p><p>“Some of them that are about him are savage,” she admitted, including “32-year-old narcissist quantifies his crimes.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-thought-she-d-be-in-her-leonardo-dicaprio-era-after-breaking-up-with-ex-husband>The star thought she’d be in her Leonardo DiCaprio era after breaking up with ex-husband</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-457097584-1024x735.jpg><p>Before meeting MGK, the actress had a 16-year-long relationship with Brian Austin Green, which included marriage and three sons.</p><p>After getting into the relationship when she was 18, she admitted she never got to experience her “young single” era, admitting she would ‘fall in love’ with people she worked with.</p><p>Although the pair went through breakups in between, they called things off for good in May 2020. On the podcast, the star joked she thought she’d ‘channel Leonard DiCaprio’ being single after so long, however, it only lasted three weeks until she met her ‘twin flame’ MGK.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2d9cLnEoJinZZakxW610malqKxdrLatuMinnmasn2KwsLnMnqWtZZ%2Bjeq6zymapnqSRqbawutKhoKllo6mutcHSZpifrJWnerSt1ZqenmWnpL%2Blv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
