Created by Andrew Goldberg, Nick Kroll, Mark Levin, and Jennifer Flackett, the show delves into the joys, thrills, horrors, and awkwardness of puberty as well as going through a bit (a lot actually) of sex education. “We’re slipping around the web and reading stuff, but we also bring in people to talk to us,” Nick Kroll told <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/big-mouth-nick-kroll-interview-1234683956/ rel="noreferrer noopener">IndieWire</a>. “We’ve been talking to sex educators since very early in the show, and in the last few seasons we’ve been talking to their students to understand from their perspective what stories are resonating with them and what stories they’d like to hear.”</p><p>On having the show air for a long time, Kroll said, “It’s beyond our wildest dreams. Getting someone to buy a pilot of a script is hard. Getting a pilot made is incredibly rare. Getting a show on the air is even more rare. Getting a show that gets to make multiple seasons is so hard and getting a spinoff of that show to expand the world you’ve created is one in a million.” He also reminisced on being on the show with childhood friend Goldberg, “The idea that it’s based on the seminal events – pun intended – of myself and someone I’ve been friends with since the first grade, the percentages are so low.”</p><p>This season, the cast graduates to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1387932/john-mulaney-dating/ rel="noreferrer noopener">high school</a> and there are even some treats included. “Knowing that we have such an international audience, we wanted to celebrate the universality of puberty,” Levin explained to Rolling Stone about an episode featuring hormone monsters all over the world.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=15><h2>Who does Megan Thee Stallion play in Big Mouth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/megan-thee-stallion-big-mouth.jpg><p>Megan Thee Stallion plays herself but as a hormone monstress in Big Mouth Season 7. Along with Connie, Bonnie, Rick, and Maury, she teaches about the impulses of sexuality and in Megan’s case, the joys of pussies and the laws of attraction.</p><p>Show creator Jennifer Flackett recalled that Megan was a huge Big Mouth fan before she got the call about audition, “Would you like to be a high school student in high school? And she was like, ‘I think I’m more of a hormone monstress,’” she said to Rolling Stone.</p><p>In true Big Mouth fashion, Megan had quite the entrance. “Aw shit, booty fatter than a pear, your hormone monstress Megan is here,” Megan slides down a giant tongue into the world of&nbsp;Big Mouth. “It’s a big mothafuckin deal they got me on the show.”&nbsp;She plays Danni’s hormone monstress as she grapples between romantic feelings for Nick while also having second thoughts about her regular hookup Travis. Obviously as the hormone monster, she only cares about who will make Danni *ahem* the wettest, but Danni’s still confused about the whole thing.</p><p>Fast forward a couple of episodes, Nick and Danni’s hookup doesn’t quite go so well. “Girl if the pussy dry, you say goodbye!” Megan says before whipping out the Dicklaration of Pussydependence saying that if they’re not feeling it then she should stop the hookup, and they do.</p><p>Big Mouth Season 7 is now streaming on Netflix.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratforKorc1mq6GdlWLAta3LpaCopl2Xtqh5zKisraBdmLWivsCcq56qXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
