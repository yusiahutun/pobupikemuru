The song touches on the classic lesson of moments going by too quickly and to&nbsp;realize how precious those memories are, too late.</p><p><strong>Caylee Hammack's Live Family Tree Will Shake You</strong></p><p>"I had never cried in a write before," Pearce&nbsp;tells&nbsp;<a href=#>American Songwriter </a>about the songwriting session for this track, "But man, did I cry at that one."</p><p>The singer penned the tune alongside Natalie Hemby and Sam Ellis about her grandparents, in their memory. Late producer Busbee, who died earlier this year, worked with Pearce on this track and her sophomore album — one of the last projects before he passed.</p><p>"Busbee thought this song was really special from the beginning,” Pearce recalls. "Everyone in the studio could just feel it. And just by coincidence, Busbee’s brother was in Nashville visiting him while we were working on this song. They had had a rocky relationship in the past and I remember the song bringing him to tears. He was just so touched by this song."</p><p>Pearce's 13-track self-titled new album is set to release on Valentine's Day 2020, Feb. 14.</p><p><strong>Country Singers Who Got Married or Engaged in 2019</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnJmiocZuvMSaqZydXZ7BbsPOp6tmmZysrrq%2FjJucZqSZoLJuwMeiqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
