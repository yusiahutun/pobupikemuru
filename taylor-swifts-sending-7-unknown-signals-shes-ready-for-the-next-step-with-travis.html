The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> were hardly spotted together in public and always maintained their need for privacy. While Taylor acknowledged Joe on a number of occasions, including in her winning speech at the Grammy Awards, the British <a href=#>celebrity</a> was rarely seen attending events together embracing the company of Tay Tay.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1736567550-1024x775.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-7-unknown-signals-shows-she-s-ready-for-the-next-step-with-travis>Taylor Swift’s 7 unknown signals shows she’s ready for the next step with Travis</h2><p><a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> may be the one <a href=#>splurging</a> to show Taylor Swift how much he means to her.</p><p>Reports say that he is <a href=#>serious</a> about the relationship, but he is definitely not the only one who is feeling the ‘this is it’ vibes. As per body language theories, Taylor Swift has been sending signals that she is ready for the next step with the NFL heartthrob.</p><p>A major part of body language communication is understanding a person’s natural instinct, showing the true intention behind their actions. From being mindful of each other’s presence with protective gestures to almost mimicking each other’s movements while walking, ‘Traylor’ seem to be heading in the right direction.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-protective-gestures>Protective gestures</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1738322026-1-1024x910.jpg><p>One of the biggest giveaways of Tay Tay and Travis Kelce’s growing closeness is best revealed in their paparazzi pictures. We can see Trav is touching Taylor’s body ever so slightly to help her in and out of the car, and keeps her hand clasped with him to show the world that Tay has someone to protect her now.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-leaning-against-each-other>Leaning against each other</h3><p>Tay Tay was first seen with Travis Kelce on September 24 when the sports celebrity took her away from the public eye in a ‘Gateway car.’ Fans have seen a drastic change in their body language since then as the couple seemed to lean into other instantaneously now.</p><p>They seemed pretty close to each other when they were spotted coming out of a dinner from Waverly Inn as well. Tay is having her share of cozy dates without fearing the paps, we love to see!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gazing-at-one-another>Gazing at one another</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1736825611-1024x713.jpg><p>Even amid cameras blinking, Travis seemed to find a second to gaze at Taylor and that shows his utmost attention to the Grammy-winning <a href=#>music</a> legend.</p><p>Despite the flashing lights, crowds and bodyguards, he only has eyes for the Cruel Summer hitmaker.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-synchronized-walking>Synchronized walking</h3><p>Traylor seems to know how to sync their walk and it’s speaking volumes. The couple’s synchronized walking depicts how much they are intimate, connected, and how in tune they are with each other.</p><p>Only when a couple is aware and connected to each other’s non-verbal signs, they can match their walking style. So Traylor’s synced walk only shows the impact of their closeness – another of Taylor Swift’s signals picked up by body language experts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mimicking-each-other-s-movements>Mimicking each other’s movements</h3><p>Along with their synchronized walks, Taylor and Travis have been spotted mimicking each other’s moves subconsciously. As per body language theory, couples who are happily in love find out that they are prone to move, smile, and speak similarly.</p><p>It is also a result of spending a considerable amount of time with someone that one finds attractive that leads to, subconsciously, mimicking their mannerisms.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-spontaneous-and-frequent-touches>Spontaneous and frequent touches</h3><p>Travis can’t seem to keep his hands to himself and fans have swooned over the clips of the NFL star casually touching Taylor’s stomach and Tay Tay’s ease in all of Travis’ advances show that they are comfortable showing that side of themselves to the public.</p><p>Body language theory claims that when the intimacy of a couple is deeper than it seems, they tend to touch each other instinctively. Traylor, we see you and we get it!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-smiling>Smiling</h3><p>The biggest tell-tale sign of Travis and Taylor’s newfound happiness in each other is in their spontaneous smiles. Taylor Swifts signals in front of the cameras has changed. The person who ‘avoided’ the cameras concerning <a href=#>her relationships</a> for half a decade seemed free and relaxed now.</p><p>Both could not help but smile as they walked holding hands.</p><p>The happiness is all over their faces, and we can hear the bell ringing, soon!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WAcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkrJ2embavs4xwZK6mm6O8uLqMrKCgppGhwG6%2Fx56qZqqVlrG6ecWoqWasmJp6r7HXrWSsrJWleri106FkraqRq7a0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
