Today in this section, we're going to find out more about his personal life and be up close and personal with the star.&nbsp;</p><h2>Grant Achatz-Relationship with Current Girlfriend</h2><p>One of the famous and rising chefs in the United States became one of those rare chefs in the country who won multiple awards for his work. His restaurant&nbsp;Alinea has been able to retain the three-star-status.</p><p>It is quite rare to achieve such feat and that too in Chicago. It is one of the highest accolades that one restaurant can achieve. Grant who was born and raised in <strong>New York</strong> decided to move to Chicago along with his girlfriend,&nbsp;<strong>Angella Snell</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/03/rsz87214470879614c610b4b.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Grant Achatz attending the James Beard Foundation Awards alongside his girlfriend Briseis Guthrie</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Flickr</strong></p><p>Since coming to Chicago, the chef made a big name for himself in the culinary industry. After his divorce with the first wife back in 2006, the actor is in a relationship with <strong>Briseis Guthrie</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of us were not aware of their relationship but then the chef shared a post on his Instagram account along with Briseis. In the post, the couple is going for a helicopter ride.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple is usually sharing precious events together. Just like in the year 2016, the couple decided to <a href=#>spend time together</a> during Christmas. Grant is also close to his girlfriend's mother and she also joined them for the festival.&nbsp;</p><p>They are together for few years but the news of their engagement isn't out in the open yet which clearly states they are not engaged yet. The chef might just take some time before taking a decision of marriage as we all know how it ended up for him the first time.&nbsp;</p><h2>Grant Achatz's Marriage and Children</h2><p>Grant and his first wife&nbsp;Angella were together since their college days. Soon after Grant moved to New York and the couple moved in together. In 2001, Grant and Angella welcomed their first child together, a boy named, <strong>Kaden</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Around the same time, Grant was suffering from stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth. As we all know how much he is into cooking and his deficiency was making him not able to taste food.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after he recovered from his health issue, Grant became a parent for the second time as he along with his girlfriend welcomed another boy named <strong>Keller</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple tied the knot in 2006 but it seems something just didn't work out as the pair decided to get separated the same year. His sons&nbsp;are grown up now as Kaden is currently studying in high school.&nbsp;</p><h2>Quick facts: Grant Achatz&nbsp;</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/03/rsz2017-mfwfmasterclassgrant-achatzphotography-credit-christian-seel-9.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Source:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Gourmet Traveller</strong></p><ul><li>Born on&nbsp;April 25, 1974 (age 43), in New York, the United States.&nbsp;</li><li>He is the son of Grant Achatz Sr.&nbsp;</li><li>He belongs to Polish ancestry.&nbsp;</li><li>He studied at&nbsp;Culinary Institute of America.</li><li>He is the main chef and owner of Alinea.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyiucSroJyZnmKwqbHFZp6rmZ6peqKvx5qrs2WUnsOwvsKem2agmah6uLXFnmSipl1nfXGCjK2fnmWTnbKnecisZJ2ZpJ67qHnSqKSep56aeq%2Bx1mauoaddnsButMisZKedp2K0qr7Ln6minZ6Z</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
