Their first child is a daughter named Ruby Sweetheart, while their son, Otis Tobias Maguire, is their second child.&nbsp;Meyer is a jewelry designer. She maintains a cordial relationship with Tobey because of their kids, but they also get along well outside of parenting.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_We_Know_About_Otis_Tobias_Maguire></span>What We Know About Otis Tobias Maguire&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tobey Maguire and his former wife, Jennifer Meyer, welcomed their second child, Otis Tobias Maguire, on May 8, 2009.&nbsp;Otis’ middle name, Tobias, is Maguire’s full first name. He is loved by his parents even though his father once admitted in an interview that he misspelled his name on his birth certificate.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “I got an extra form and filled it out and misspelled Otis. [I] brought it back to my wife and was acting very innocent. ‘Oh, I’m so excited! It’s official! Look,’ and I handed her the paper.”</p><p>In 2020, a source close to Tobey revealed that Leonardo DiCaprio, a longtime friend of his who attended his wedding to Meyer in 2007, shares a close relationship with both of his kids.&nbsp;The source said: “Leo tags along for more family-friendly activities with Tobey, his wife, and kids. They will visit the beach or grab Sunday brunch. Leo is great with Ruby and Otis.”&nbsp;</p><p>The insider also stated that DiCaprio was a natural with the kids. He was described as very “hands-on,” offering to help cut up their food and carrying them when they needed to cross busy streets.&nbsp;</p><p>The source said: “He would be a great dad!”</p><p>Tobey is very private, so little else is known about his kids. However, one clear thing is that the “Spider-Man” actor is a great dad who never neglects his duties.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_Between_Otis_Tobias_Maguires_Parents></span>What Happened Between Otis Tobias Maguire’s Parents?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Otis Tobias Maguire’s parents first met in 2003. They dated for about four years before they tied the knot in 2007. The wedding took place in Hawaii and was attended by stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Lukas Haas.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fam.jpg><p>In 2016, Maguire and Meyer revealed they would be parting ways after almost a decade of marriage. Their statement at the time read:&nbsp;</p><p>“After much soul searching and consideration, we have decided to separate as a couple. As devoted parents, our priority is to raise our children with enduring love, respect, and friendship.”</p><p>The announcement surprised many; speculations about what may have caused it were rampant on social media. A source later revealed that the pair separated because they had incompatible lifestyles.&nbsp;</p><p>The source said: “They’ve been living separate lives for a while. They have completely different interests and haven’t seemed to be connecting.”</p><p>While Tobey enjoys being private and often prefers staying home, Meyer is an outgoing person with a very active social life and several girlfriends, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston. The insider also confirmed that the former couple had plans to remain friends because of their kids.&nbsp;</p><p>The source said: “It’s a marriage that’s ending, but a bond and a family as strong as any I know. They’re remarkable people and very supportive of each other.”&nbsp;Four years after they announced their separation, Meyer filed for divorce in 2020. She requested joint legal and physical custody of their two children.&nbsp;</p><p>The jewelry designer also confirmed in a 2017 interview that she and her former husband were cordial. She said: “I don’t know what to do without him — Tobey’s my best friend. I lucked out in the biggest of ways. He’s still very sweet to me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Fatherhood_Changed_Tobey_Maguire></span>Fatherhood Changed Tobey Maguire&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2006, Tobey Maguire revealed at a press conference for “Spider-Man 3” that becoming a father “changed” him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tobeyy.jpg><p>He claimed to have changed a lot since he welcomed his daughter and admitted that he loves being a father. He confirmed that fatherhood is exactly like people say, but that one must become one to realize that.&nbsp;</p><p>During the press conference, Tobey confessed that fatherhood made him think twice about his career choices. He said:&nbsp;</p><p>“I think that the greatest effect [having a baby] will have is on what the locations of movies are, more so than what the content is, although it may affect my decisions about the content as well.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s 2023, and Tobey still feels the same about his kids. He is no longer as active as an actor, but his bond with his kids has gotten stronger, and he maintains a connection to A-list stars, including <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02amraGjYsGwrsiaqmalkZzCqr7EZquompWueq6txq6gq52jYsCmr86nm2abmJ65pXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
