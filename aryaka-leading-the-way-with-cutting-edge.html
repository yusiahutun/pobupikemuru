Companies that had proactively adapted to significant shifts in the business environment over the preceding four years were well-positioned. SASE’s primary goal was to empower intricate networks within hybrid setups, with service providers extending security controls across these networks comprehensively.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the onset of the pandemic accelerated the pace of digital transformation, swiftly transforming SASE’s role into an urgent necessity for businesses worldwide. As cybercrime rates soared, SASE vendors faced the formidable challenge of aligning their network and security capabilities with the swiftly changing business dynamics. It was a monumental undertaking, one that Aryaka has fully committed to addressing.</p><p>With a history spanning nearly 15 years, Aryaka has demonstrated steady, organic growth, recently achieving a milestone of over $100 million in annual recurring revenue. The company has strategically invested substantial resources into security development in recent years, all while maintaining a focus on sustainable growth and profitability. Aryaka stands poised to navigate these challenges and continue its trajectory as a significant player in the SASE landscape.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Unveiling the Architect of Success at Aryaka</h2><p>Renuka Nadkarni, the Chief Product Officer at Aryaka, boasts an illustrious career spanning over two decades, making her a driving force behind Aryaka’s remarkable journey.

In the pre-SASE era, enterprises often used a segmented approach, dividing networking and security functions between branch offices and cloud-based solutions, leading to complexity and high costs.
