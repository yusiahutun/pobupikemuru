Intel just released its <a href=#>14th gen Core desktop processors</a> last month, and now System76 has updated its Thelio lineup of desktop PCs with the new chips, making them better than ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>System76 sells a few different desktop PCs, ranging from the budget-friendly Thelio Spark (<a href=#>which debuted last month</a>) to the multi-GPU Thelio Mega. Today, the company announced that the mid-range Thelio Mira can now be purchased with the latest 14th gen Intel Core processors, giving them a performance boost over the previously-available configurations. This release comes after System76 <a href=#>updated the design</a> of all its Thelio desktops, with greatly enhanced airflow, serviceability, and cable management on top of all the great stuff the company has already doing. The improved airflow minimizes thermal throttling, guaranteeing sustained performance even under heavy workloads, especially in configurations featuring high-end components.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This new release is powered by the 14th Gen Intel Core i7-14700K and i9-14900K processors. The Pro tier now offers 4 additional CPU cores, and Premium and Elite configurations can reach a maximum frequency of 6.0 GHz. This translates to a significant increase in processing capabilities, making it ideal for professionals such as video editors, content creators, gamers, podcasters, Twitch streamers, and audio editors, as the improved hardware allows for faster render times and smoother gameplay experiences.</p><p>You also have the option of upgrading to an NVIDIA RTX 4080 graphics card if you happen to need more gaming performance. The desktops can also be configured with up to 128GB of DDR5 RAM and 32TB of storage, so no matter how demanding your computing needs might be, they could be very well covered by the Thelio Mira computers.</p><p>The updated Thelio Spark models are now available for purchase on <a href=#>System76's website</a>, and you can check them out now. Just don't expect them to come for cheap — they start at $1,599. There's no word on when the cheaper Thelio spark will be updated with the new CPUs, but the other Thelio desktops use AMD chips, so there's no need to wait for upgrades on those.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">System76</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGiqsqukmrp4gtJmpZ6vXZmytLfTqKdmoJGoeqq6056jrGVhacGpecaepWaooqSwpr%2FSqKmsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
