So when heard about bagel dogs, we knew we had to try them. And they did not disappoint! The chewy bagel exterior gives way to a classic hot dog, and you get to enjoy two favorite flavors in one delicious bite. Even better: They’re surprisingly easy to whip up at home. We talked to recipe pros to get their best tips and tricks, whether you want to make them from scratch or try a clever shortcut. Either way, we guarantee bagel dogs are going to be one of your new favorite treats.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who invented bagel dogs?</h2><p>The origins of this treat date back to 1980, when Milan R. Burger wanted to sell a snack similar to pigs in a blanket his bakery, Temptee Bagel Company. What <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he created were bagel dogs</a>, which used a full-sized hot dog rather than small franks and bagel dough from the bakery.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>This snack traditionally consists of hot dogs that are wrapped in dough, boiled and then baked to golden perfection. Combining hot dogs and bagels works because the dough absorbs the sausage’s salty and bold flavors. Plus, this snack is often topped with sesame seeds or salt for added crunch.</p><p>This snack grew in popularity and soon made its way onto concession stand menus and freezer aisles, where it remains a popular treat. However, it’s simple to prepare this finger food right from the comfort of your home!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The key to soft and fluffy homemade bagel dogs</h2><p>Biting into the pillowy dough is the best part of eating bagel dogs. That’s why <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Randhawa</a>, recipe creator behind <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Forked Spoon</a>, suggests using bread flour if you’re making the dough from scratch. “You can use all-purpose flour, but bread flour gives the dough a chewier texture,” she says. This chewiness is the result of bread flour’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">higher protein content than the all-purpose kind</a>, which produces more gluten (wheat proteins) for a stretchier dough.</p><p>Another way to create light and tasty dough: give it plenty of time to rise. “If you want to prepare ahead, you can let the dough rise in the refrigerator overnight. This also tends to enhance the flavor,” Randhawa adds. These two tips making working with homemade dough for bagel dogs as hassle-free as possible.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make bagel dogs</h2><p>Whether you’re craving a traditional or speedy version of this snack, these bagel dog recipes are a delicious choice over the freezer kind.
