 How to write for Blogging Students
At the end of every two years, my parents remind me to pack my belongings and I realise that the time has come again for me to say goodbye to my existing surroundings and start again in my new home."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Travelling is a huge part of my life. I pack and unpack boxes whenever the government tells us to move.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The whole thing was confusing when I was little. I didn't understand why I had to leave while my friends stayed behind, or why I had to learn new customs and traditions.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>It could also make studying tough. When I first moved to Germany, I picked up German from my teachers and peers in a local kindergarten even before I was able to fully grasp my native language, Korean. But just when I started to speak and understand German, we moved to Monterey, California, where I was taught English. For the next couple of years, I struggled to learn the language, as I often got confused with the grammatical rules.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Learning about different languages and cultures as I moved around was one of my biggest challenges, but it has been a major part of my personal growth.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Wasil Rezk, an Egyptian student who has lived in eight different countries, says: "Travelling has allowed me to learn about different cultures and people. I noticed how generalisations and stereotypes can make us blind to the truth."</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>My biggest transition in life was when I first set foot in a Caracas, Venezuela, where I lived before moving to Uruguay - my current home. It was my first time in a Latin American country, so I had no idea what kind of experience Venezuela would give me over the next two years.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>When you initially arrive in a new country, culture shock is something that will make you a temporary introvert. But once you become used to your surroundings, you get comfortable pretty quickly.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Jade Johnson, an international student who has lived in Switzerland, Mozambique, Uruguay, England and Bermuda, says: "When I first came to Uruguay from Bermuda, I had the habit of saying hello to strangers walking past me on the streets because almost everyone knew each other in Bermuda. But I dropped the habit afterwards for the fear of accidentally offending them.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>"I overcame culture shock by going out and meeting new people. I realised that focusing on the past would not allow me to move forward. So I decided to be strong and deal with it."</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Moving around never gave me much time to develop deep relationships with my friends. When I finally got to know someone, it was always time to say goodbye. I would often to cry for days when I was younger, as I would miss my friends. Now it's much easier to keep in touch via social media. A couple of years ago I found my friends from Germany again on Facebook. It was an amazing feeling to hear from them again.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>At the end of every experience in a new country, I feel like I've grown a little more open-minded and accepting. I never thought that I would get used to Venezuela, but I ended up falling in love with the place and the community. I now openly embrace whatever changes await me because I know that I will learn from the experience.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Lorena Leon, a student from the US who has studied abroad in Germany and Uruguay, says: "When I was moving to Uruguay, I had convinced myself that I would make it through the four years of my high school without making any friends, but that was not the case.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>"Now I'm back in the States after four years, and I feel like my own country is a strange place because I've been so used to how things work in Uruguay."</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>All of us will leave the house or place that we call home at least once in our lifetime whether for university, a relocation, or a job. We may be homesick or surprised by what we experience in a new place. But these feelings are only temporary, and we will find ourselves at home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJ2UqrCiwMiopWiln6fBor7BqJirnF9nfXKAjqOspWdiaXy0wNSdnKesXZmutrPHrZyrZZ%2BbeqW1z6WmppmkYsCixcinnmafn6Sxo8XEZqurmaaauQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
