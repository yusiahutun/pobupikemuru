In fact, it is an OG skincare ingredient known for calming irritation, reducing acne, and more. But as we know, while social media is wonderful for connecting with people, we'd be remiss not to mention the amount of misinformation that comes along with these trends. To cut through the noise, we tapped two board-certified dermatologists to break down everything there is to know about witch hazel so you can make the best, most well-informed decisions next time you find yourself shopping the skincare aisle. From what it is to its potential side effects, their answers are below.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Marisa Garshick</a>, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Dendy Engelman</a>, MD, FACMS, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist and Mohs surgeon at the Shafer Clinic.<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-witch-hazel></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Witch Hazel?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Witch&nbsp;Hazel, also known as hamamelis virginiana, is a type of flowering shrub that can be incorporated into a skincare routine given its multiple skin benefits — including that it can help balance oil production," explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Marisa Garshick,</a> MD, a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In Witch Hazel-infused skincare products, twigs and bark are used, explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dendy Engelman, </a>MD, FACMS, FAAD, a board-certified dermatologist and Mohs surgeon at the Shafer Clinic.

According to Dr. Engelman, this ingredient is a natural astringent that holds anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties, which can help reduce inflammation and minimize the appearance of breakouts. As an added bonus, it is also known to absorb excess oil and acne-causing bacteria to prevent clogged pores and keep the skin clear.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-potential-side-effects></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Potential Side Effects</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since witch hazel absorbs into the skin, it sometimes gets a bad rep for being excessively drying. But Dr. Engelman says that witch hazel is usually well-tolerated by the skin, but when formulated with other ingredients, it can irritate or over-dry the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It is important to look for formulations that are alcohol-free to minimize the potential for dryness or irritation," adds Dr. Garshick. "Furthermore, some&nbsp;witch&nbsp;hazel&nbsp;products may also incorporate other ingredients such as glycerin and aloe vera." Dr. Engelman also adds that if you're known to have any sensitivity, it's best to do a patch test just in case.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-use-witch-hazel-for-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Use Witch Hazel for Skin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typically, Witch Hazel is incorporated into a skincare routine as a toner. "Witch hazel preps, cleans, tones, and balances skin before applying additional products," Dr. Engelman explains. "You can add&nbsp;serums, moisturizer, and SPF over it as part of your morning routine or before bed to help cleanse and remove bacteria and oils from the skin before your nighttime regimen." &nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But while witch hazel is very popular in toners, it can be incorporated into other types of products, too. Dr. Garshick says it can be put into different product formulations, including cleansers, toners, facial mists, gels, creams or lotions, wipes, or pads, depending on the desired effect.&nbsp;"For people with combination/normal skin, it can be beneficial to apply toner to clean skin using a cotton round twice daily — morning and night," she adds.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ingredients-to-look-out-for></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ingredients to Look Out For</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For those with sensitive skin, Dr. Engelman recommends avoiding Witch Hazel products that also contain harsh actives and chemical exfoliants, as that may lead to more dryness or irritation. But you're safe to use Witch Hazel with other acne-fighting ingredients, such <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>as niacinamide</a>, which helps minimize pores and even out skin tone. She adds <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>tea tree oil</a>, another popular acne-fighting ingredient, works well with witch hazel. "Together, they are antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-find-the-right-witch-hazel-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Find the Right Witch Hazel Products</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Witch hazel is one of those ingredients that can benefit all skin types. But according to Dr. Engleman, you should always check to make sure the product's not diluted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With that in mind, though, people with certain skin types should lean toward specific formulations. For example, Dr. Engelman says that people with dry or sensitive skin should opt for alcohol-free products, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Humphrey's Alcohol-Free Toners</a>, to prevent over-drying the skin. Additionally, Dr. Garshick says to look for additional skincare ingredients in the formulas if you're looking for something in particular. For example, if you're looking to hydrate the skin, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Thayer's Alcohol-Free Facial Toner with Rose Petal</a> also incorporates moisturizing glycerin and aloe vera.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From non-toxic makeup and skincare to sustainability practices,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Clean Slate</a>&nbsp;is an exploration of all things in the green beauty space.

"Witch hazel’s anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and balancing properties make it a great ingredient for toning the skin." She cautions that using it as a toner alone will irritate some skin types — especially sensitive skin. She recommends seeking a toner that pairs witch hazel with nourishing ingredients to offset any potential negative side effects.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Will witch hazel dry out my skin?</span></p><p>Dr. Engelman says that when used in excess or used in its purest form, witch hazel can cause or exacerbate dryness.

"However, those with extremely sensitive or dry skin, or certain skin conditions like rosacea, may want to avoid witch hazel as it can be too harsh for them." If you're unsure, she recommends doing a patch test or asking your dermatologist.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=4 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What are the benefits of adding witch hazel to my skincare routine?</span></p><p>"Witch hazel has a variety of benefits to skincare," says Dr. Engelman.

It can also help soothe sunburn and bug bites, and has a cooling effect on the skin."</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571qKrnKBdna67sctmmZ6mlZu2tb%2BMb25ta2FqfQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
