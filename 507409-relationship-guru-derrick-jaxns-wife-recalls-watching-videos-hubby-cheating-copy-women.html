I didn't know who I was, I actually had a post on my page where I said 'I knew her body better than I knew my own'. Several women. I spent a lot of time, I went into a deep hole where I was studying these women. I would go to their profiles and be studying their pages and what they wear and I knew when they had met up. I watched their videos of them sleeping together and tried to imitate that and recreate that in our relationship so that he can choose me and want me. That is a low point to be in and I hate that I even got to a point where that was a thing. But it was. I completely lost myself," she said.<p class=align-left>A snippet of the interview was reshared on Facebook by Tasha K who said her heart was breaking for Jackson and prayed for her healing and protection.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e0d564a8a93c62dd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nairobi Woman Who Dated Man for 17 Years Says He Didn't Marry Her: "I Still Believe in Love"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Watch the video below:</p><p class=align-left>Jaxn immersed lots of followers after he went viral giving women relationship advice on the type of men they ought to avoid.</p><p class=align-left>But his ex-wife's revelations have left social media users with mixed reactions with some saying women should cancel the relationship guru.</p><h2>Jaxn admits to cheating on his wife</h2><p class=align-left>The relationship expert had in the past sat down with his then-wife and <a href=#>admitted that he indeed stepped out</a> of his marriage.</p><p class=align-left>Then he went ahead to imply that there were other women in the mix after a woman came out to accuse him of lying to her.</p>“I am not talking about just casually kicking it maybe a lunch or something like that, I am talking about as serious as s*x to s*xual flirtation and meeting up and that kind of thing,” he said.<p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZm5oZ2l9ennRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkoK2iqnqlsdGroJyjXZ%2BuubrSZq6inpViv6avwKWjrGWnlsGktMinnmaumZmysL%2BMoaybmqlisKmxwK2gp59dmLyxxYywpqadnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
