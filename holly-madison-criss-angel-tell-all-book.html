While a good portion of her new tell-all, &#34;Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny,&#34; is all about her volatile relationship with the Playboy head honcho, she also devotes a few chapters to her troubled history with magician Criss Angel.
In the book, Holly says she met the Las Vegas magician while she was still living in the mansion -- but insists the two only flirted, saying nothing happened between them until after she split from Hef."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"He pleaded with me to move in with him by Halloween during one of my trips to Las Vegas."</p><p>Madison says she resisted at first, but adds that eventually her "need to feel loved would win out over my need for independence."</p><p>Holly goes on to say Angel would constantly tip off tabloids on stories, set up "candid" paparazzi shoots and used their relationship as "misdirection" against the bad reviews his Sin City show was getting at the time.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Madison Talks Orgies with Hugh Hefner Inside the Mansion</strong></a></p><p>She adds that he would have bodyguards accompany her everywhere she went -- calling it "awkward and embarrassing." She says he also isolated her from her friends, encouraged her to quit her job, became jealous of her own fame and had an "explosive temper."</p><p>"For all his fame, fortune, and success, Criss, to me, seemed crippingly insecure. This was starting to feel all too familiar," she says, comparing him to Hefner. "Hef was a master of manipulation and knew how to cripple a girl's self-esteem. Criss, on the other hand, just scared me."</p><p>She says that the magician never hit her, but she was "scared that something of that nature might be lurking around the corner."</p><p><a href=#><strong>Kendra Slams Holly -- Says She Has an "Ulterior" Motive</strong></a></p><p>Once the facade started to fade, Madison says she "found him to be unintelligent" and "virtually illiterate" -- and realized they had very little in common.</p><p>She eventually left him and finally pursued her own dreams, landing a reality TV series of her own, appearing on <strong>"Dancing with the Stars"</strong> and starring in a Las Vegas show.</p><p>These days she's married to <strong>Pasquale Rotella</strong> and the two have one daughter together, Rainbow.</p><p>Holly's book, <strong>"Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny,"</strong> is available now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnZ7j3BmaWpfnbytuNhmpJqcmai8r3nCq6Csq12Wu6ixy2arnqScYq6tuIybpqijXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
