Josh Hartnett, 38, and his longtime girlfriend, Tamsin Egerton, are expecting their second baby together! The 28-year-old model flaunted her growing belly for the first time at the Vanity Fair Oscars party on Sunday, Feb. 26.
At the event, pregnant Tamsin happily enjoyed some fried dough. “This is not feeding the baby nourishment,” she joked, according to People.
