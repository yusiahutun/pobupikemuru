He has always maintained his innocence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2015, Reddy was released on bail but there were strict conditions attached, including not being able to enter certain areas such as Ballari.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/06/30/72e3bb19-c02f-44eb-878f-ba37aba506c0_3f4232b8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In April 2021, Reddy appealed to the Supreme Court of India to relax his bail conditions, according to The Hindu, citing a six-year delay in his trial. The publication reported that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) opposed the move, believing Reddy was involved in a “notorious mining scam” and that his return to Ballari would hinder the trial.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">India Today reports Reddy is known as the “Ballari King” because of his extravagant lifestyle before his arrest.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Anil and Tina Ambani’s sweet love story – and 4 years apart</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Police raid discovers luxe life</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/06/30/581cc6db-ab1c-421d-bc18-03673b21e108_47822556.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to India Today, when the CBI raided Reddy’s home in 2011, items confiscated included gold-plated plates, bowls, spoons, forks and ashtrays. It was also reported that the house where Reddy stayed had an indoor swimming pool, massage parlour, home theatre and bomb shelter. The Hindustan Times even reported that the businessman’s private helicopter, named Rukmini, and several cars were also seized in the raid.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">A wedding extravaganza</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/06/30/1400e090-ff9f-4b1d-af16-6c0f40e511b5_90ab99f0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the charges against him and having his property and possessions seized, Reddy made headlines again in 2016 with his daughter’s extravagant wedding. The Hindustan Times reported at the time that the wedding invite was a box with an LCD screen that played a video of Reddy’s daughter, Brahmani, and son-in-law Rajeev Reddy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">India Today reported that the whole family put in an appearance, and photos of the wedding included the bride twirling around and the family blessing the couple by throwing flowers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The wedding was held in the grounds of the Bangalore Palace and welcomed as many as 50,000 guests. The venue was supposedly decked out to look like the ruins of Hampi, the capital of the ancient Vijayanagar Empire.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to The Guardian, the wedding was estimated to have cost more than US$75 million. Indian activist T. Narasimha Murthy told media at the time that Reddy had to hire around 3,000 security personal to stop protesters from attending, after reports of the luxury wedding sparked outrage during a period when Indians were going through a cash crisis.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The gold throne</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As if that wasn’t testament enough to his extravagance, during the raid on his home a “throne” weighing around 15kg was also discovered by police. The regal chair reportedly featured Reddy’s initials, GJR, monogrammed in diamonds, and Reddy said he had even been “crowned” in a secret ceremony. The Hindustan Times also reported that at the time of the raids, police confiscated 30kg of gold.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Why Mukesh Ambani’s nephews Jai Anmol and Jai Anshul value what they have</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Expensive threads</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/06/30/16684d44-cf9e-4fdf-bbea-fea16e8992d3_776f4907.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All of Reddy’s shirts reportedly had real gold threads woven into them, with the shirts alone thought to be worth more than US$1,300 each.
