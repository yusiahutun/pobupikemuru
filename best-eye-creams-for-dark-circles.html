Panda eyes and raccoon eyes make them sound endearing, but when you’re facing those shadows in the mirror, they’re anything but. And while layers of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>concealer</a> can help, they’re only masking the issue. To really <strong>solve your dark under-eye anxiety</strong> problem, you <strong>need a heavy-hitting eye cream</strong> in your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>skincare routine</a>, yet so many of them just don't cut it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We decided that we were done looking tired when we actually had a lovely night's rest, and we <strong>spent</strong> <strong>five weeks — and 744 hours! — testing </strong>22 of the <strong>most popular eye creams for dark circles</strong>. We evaluated each for how well they <strong>brightened and neutralized</strong> our dark under-eye hues, along with the <strong>formula's consistency, texture, and absorption</strong>. We compiled our notes to score and rank each eye cream, editing the list down to our very favorites. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>After thoroughly testing each one for five weeks</a>, these are hands-down the 15 best eye creams for dark circles that made us look <strong>bright-eyed</strong> <strong>and well-rested </strong>every day (even when we weren't).<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-isdin-k-ox-under-eye-brightening-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Isdin K-Ox Eye Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Isdin K-Ox Under-Eye Brightening Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0zA3m87xOQTU5R7m-iqrnpH939E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/isdin-k-ox-under-eye-brightening-cream-2c34b84ea83545b781be5b131b8affef.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Despite the lightweight, fluid formula, a little went a long way to instantly reduce puffiness.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Though it really worked, it took several weeks to reduce our dark circles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This product is a real winner — it features an <strong>easy-to-wear, fast-absorbing formula </strong>that only necessitated the use of a pea-sized amount to treat the entire under-eye. The <strong>cooling ceramic applicator </strong>made it simple to spread the fluid texture and <strong>didn’t leave any stickiness</strong> behind as it dried. We noticed an <strong>instant improvement in texture and the hydration</strong> levels of our skin (thanks, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hyaluronic acid</a>), but the real results came a few weeks later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite bouts of insomnia and a few dreary red-eye flights (plus the accompanying jetlag), we saw <strong>significant improvement</strong> in our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dark circles</a> and even our <strong>puffy eyes looked smaller and flatter</strong>, too. We were astounded by how much better our eye bags looked as well as how <strong>firm and smooth our skin appeared</strong>, especially viewing the stark before and after photos at the end of our five-week testing period. Patience is a virtue here, but trust the process and keep going, and you'll be just as shocked as we were.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Vitamin K, hyaluronic acid, haloxyl<strong>｜Best for:</strong> Wrinkles, skin laxity, discoloration<strong>｜Fragrance-Free:</strong> No<strong>｜Size:</strong> 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-neutrogena-rapid-wrinkle-repair-retinol-pro-anti-wrinkle-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Pro+ Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Pro+ Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SGM5ScLdUQH1roS9w5bS-paJGKI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/neutrogena-rapid-wrinkle-repair-retinol-pro--anti-wrinkle-eye-cream-2ef5f98a27424f0ea2d0f2402b60e36a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This rich cream left our skin feeling quite hydrated and firm without leaving any residue behind.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It created a slightly uncomfortable warming sensation upon application.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With just a half-pea-sized amount, we were able to spread the gel formula from Neutrogena across our entire under-eye, melting into our skin to provide a <strong>surge of hydration</strong>. While some hydrating eye creams leave the skin feeling sticky, this one <strong>dried perfectly</strong> into a <strong>matte finish</strong>, making it an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>incredible base layer for concealer</a>. We were particularly impressed by this drugstore eye cream as we watched our <strong>dark shadows neutralize</strong> into <strong>even-toned, smooth skin</strong>, while the extra hydration <strong>inflated our crepey skin</strong>, causing our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>fine lines</a> to fade and firm up over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At the beginning of the test, we noticed a slight warming sensation as we dabbed the cream into our skin, which we attribute to the retinol, but as our skin acclimated to the new product, it subsided.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Retinol, sodium hyaluronate, glycerin<strong>｜Best for:</strong> Dryness, wrinkles, dullness<strong>｜Fragrance-Free:</strong> Yes<strong>｜Size:</strong> 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-la-mer-the-eye-concentrate></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>La Mer The Eye Concentrate</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="La Mer The Eye Concentrate" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uiUYceUpmWnX-9dyhZwPvJqEERc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/la-mer-the-eye-concentrate-eye-cream-0c67ac525644454f88db950c1086b1b1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The silky formula feels especially fabulous when applied with the included applicator.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It left our sensitive skin a little bit red where we’d applied it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This product offered a <strong>luxe experience</strong> that was unparalleled by the other formulas we tested. We have skin as dry as the Sahara, which causes our under-eyes to be especially delicate and textured, and this <strong>silky formula</strong> glided on with ease, <strong>quenching our skin’s thirst</strong> without feeling heavy or interfering with our makeup. As we placed the metal tip on our skin, it had a <strong>cooling sensation</strong> that <strong>helped with puffiness</strong> and blood circulation, as we massaged the eye cream back and forth into our skin. We loved how indulgent and relaxing the entire experience felt, and after two weeks, our under-eyes started to <strong>look firmer, softer, and more supple</strong>, which <strong>only looked better as the weeks went on</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although we experienced some minor irritation a handful of times during the testing period, we loved how moisturized our under-eyes looked and felt, and the slight annoyance didn't stop us from using it every day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: The brand's proprietary Miracle Broth, lime tea concentrate, licorice root extract<strong>｜Best for:</strong> Dryness, wrinkles<strong>｜Fragrance-Free:</strong> Not listed<strong>｜Size:</strong> 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dark-circles-and-bags-drunk-elephant-c-tango-multivitamin-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dark Circles and Bags</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant C-Tango Multivitamin Eye Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Drunk Elephant C-Tango Multivitamin Eye Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MNtYHvwk1v6qRo2ibu0BVBa_Org=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/c-tango-multivitamin-eye-cream-26e77e906bd84f3eb195a1629360eda5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It had a very luxe, velvety texture that felt rich and soothing yet absorbed quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The packaging is deceptively large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you don’t like the feeling of a heavy eye cream leaving residue under your eye, this one is worth a try. We found that the formula was comparable to an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>indulgent anti-aging moisturizer</a>, yet it <strong>spread easily</strong> and <strong>absorbed rapidly</strong>, leaving our under-eyes <strong>feeling refreshed and hydrated</strong>. As a bonus, it had an immediate plumping effect, which quickly neutralized our gray shadows at the inner corners, and its <strong>moisturizing texture</strong> allowed our <strong>concealer to slide right across without pilling</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our biggest disappointment with this eye cream was its packaging: Its bulky shape made us think there'd be more eye cream inside than there actually was, which was surprising considering the price point.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Vitamin C, peptides, superoxide dismutase<strong>｜Best for:</strong> Discoloration, dryness, puffiness<strong>｜Fragrance-Free:</strong> Yes<strong>｜Size:</strong> 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dark-circles-and-puffiness-roc-retinol-correxion-line-smoothing-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dark Circles and Puffiness</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="RoC Retinol Correxion Line Smoothing Eye Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/K_xnTuNIrEwy-PCfhMoOkPTneOU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/roc-retinol-correxion-line-smoothing-eye-cream-c3b5679b6ee54d9cb815d703c07d916d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>We found our skin to be firmer and much more moisturized after use.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> We wish it also had a bit of pearlescence for instant brightening.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our sensitive skin doesn't often play nice with retinol, but we were encouraged that the ingredients list was a who's who in the world of<strong> gentle, soothing skincare</strong>. With <strong>moisturizing glycerin </strong>and<strong> protein-rich lactose</strong> to counter-act the potentially irritating retinol, the formula didn't trigger an angry reaction whatsoever. Instead, our skin <strong>felt nothing but refreshed, soft and supple</strong> with every application. Just to be on the safe side, we only used this eye cream at night, but even with a once-daily application, our eyes looked less puffy within one week, and by week two, our dark circles had <strong>significantly faded</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Considering how much we liked the feel and effect of this RoC formula, we think it's a total win for anyone with sensitive skin. In fact, it's so moisturizing that we started to apply it in the mornings, too, and we would have loved just the slightest touch of pearlescence for a luminizing effect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Retinol, mineral complex<strong>｜Best for:</strong> Puffiness, wrinkles<strong>｜Fragrance-Free:</strong> Yes<strong>｜Size:</strong> 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-firming-and-brightening-summer-fridays-light-aura-vitamin-c--peptide-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Firming and Brightening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Summer Fridays Light Aura Eye Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Summer Fridays Light Aura Vitamin C + Peptide Eye Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7VyK_d0JrWQ9BoqRFVrPQ8XMZm0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/summer-fridays-light-aura-vitamin-c---peptide-eye-cream-0cdd27fc859347bfac1dc9cd9ce7cce4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The silky-smooth formula had a flawless spreadable texture that absorbed quickly.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The product had more sparkle and luminosity than what you might prefer in an eye cream.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This thick cream was a pleasure to use, with a <strong>rich yet lightweight</strong>, <strong>fast-absorbing texture</strong> that left our skin <strong>indulgently moisturized</strong> without any pilling under makeup or when paired with other skincare products in our routine. A little went a long way; we used a pea-sized amount, which was more than enough for a full application. It left our skin <strong>looking and feeling soft</strong>, <strong>hydrated</strong>, and <strong>dewy</strong> long after it sank in. Powered by a potent vitamin C and peptide blend, along with a jolt of caffeine,<strong> immediately neutralized</strong> our under-eye darkness and <strong>de-puffed</strong> the area as well. We also loved the cream's light coral hue that worked as a subtle <strong>color-corrector</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This formula contains tiny flecks of shimmer to supercharge the radiance, giving it the moniker “Light Aura.” We enjoyed the extra luminosity, but those who prefer skin sans-sparkle may want to choose another eye cream from the list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Vitamin C, peptides, caffeine<strong>｜Best for:</strong> Dryness, dullness, laxity<strong>｜Fragrance-Free:</strong> No fragrance added<strong>｜Size:</strong> 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-retinol-glow-recipe-avocado-melt-retinol-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best with Retinol</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Glow Recipe Avocado Melt Fine Line Eye Cream with Retinol</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Glow Recipe Avocado Melt Retinol Eye Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nVRJAgQ76C_1YC49MRyWoJfTex0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Glow-Recipe-Avocado-Melt-Retinol-Eye-Sleeping-Mask--fa6957e3a5ff4eed84ab41b4d8ef6168.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Despite the fact that this formula contains retinol, it was perfectly comfortable and soothing on our sensitive skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It would be easier to get the cream out of the jar if it came with an applicator.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Glow Recipe’s formula was the best Korean beauty product we tried for this eye cream story, and that was in large part due to the texture and ingredients. <strong>A little goes a very long way</strong>, warming up easily on the fingertip and <strong>absorbing within a minute</strong> of application. It <strong>never felt heavy</strong> or noticeable on the skin (and performed <strong>great under makeup</strong>!), although we loved slathering it on at night as a makeshift overnight <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eye mask</a>. We also <strong>never experienced any burning, redness</strong>, or any other sensation while using this cream, even though our skin is quite sensitive, which was a pleasant surprise considering that this product contains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>retinol</a>, a notorious skin irritant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were surprised by how much product we had leftover at the end of our five-week testing period — we hardly made a dent in it despite using it twice a day — but we do wish it came with an applicator to help us reach every last drop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Avocado, retinol, niacinamide<strong>｜Best for:</strong> Fine lines, wrinkles, dryness<strong>｜Fragrance-Free:</strong> No synthetic fragrances added<strong>｜Size:</strong> 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-vitamin-c-ole-henriksen-banana-bright-vitamin-c-brightening-eye-crme></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Vitamin C</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ole Henriksen Banana Bright+ Eye Crème</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ole Henriksen Banana Bright+ Vitamin C Brightening Eye Cr&amp;egrave;me" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_6Rw3r5I3KKqUp0hz2XaedZh1kg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Ole-Henriksen-Banana-Bright-Vitamin-C-Eye-Creme-5ce261cb14104ef088f57ba0b7c24663.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It spread easily and absorbed quickly, making it a nice daytime option to apply before makeup.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> We didn’t see a dramatic long-term improvement; this is more of an instant-effect product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This formula harnesses the <strong>brightening effect</strong> of banana powder to prep and prime tired under-eyes for the day. As soon as we opened the jar and saw the yellow-orange tint filled with<strong> light-reflecting</strong> yellow pigments to <strong>color-correct shadows</strong>, we knew this eye cream meant business. Immediately after tapping the <strong>lightweight vegan cream</strong> into our skin, our dark circles appeared less prominent — before we even applied our concealer. The brand's proprietary triple vitamin C complex is packed with antioxidants, which can help improve skin radiance and uneven tone.

You’ll also have to do your part by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. “Proper care for yourself is what matters most in treating under eye circles,” says Chevalier.
