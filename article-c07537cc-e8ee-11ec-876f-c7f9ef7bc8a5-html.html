Harold Keyes Jr., 29, and his co-defendants worked together to distribute the drug in April 2020 before being arrested, according to court documents and U.S. Attorney Darren LaMarca and Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent Brad Byerley.</p><p>Agents intercepted meth-related communi- cations occurring in and around a residence in Hattiesburg. Keyes was stopped by Hattiesburg Police Department for a traffic violation and officers discovered more than a kilogram of meth wrapped in three bundles hidden in the front of Keyes’ pants on April 24, 2020.</p><p>In addition to the prison sentence, Keyes will have five years of supervised release and was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine. The case is the result of an extensive investigation, dubbed “Don’t Tell on Me Bro,” which began as an operation targeting illegal drug trafficking in the Hattiesburg area. “Don’t Tell on</p><p>Me Bro” is part of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces investigation. OCDETF identifies, disrupts and dismantles the highest-level drug traffickers, money launderers, gangs and transnational criminal organizations that threaten the United States by using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach that leverages the strengths of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies against criminal networks, according to the press release.</p><p>The case was investigated by the DEA, Lamar County Sheriff’s Office, the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics, Forrest County Sheriff’s, Columbia Police Department and HPD.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcL%2FUrKeem6Ritq95wqinZqeeYrCwvIydpqado6m2pHnSoaaorJmjtG6vwK6eoaxflr%2B1tcKlnJibYGyCdIPCnGSecJWaenJ9xJxkcW9mm3qkg8VynJ9vkpiFooGNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
