And, sure, you could pamper your feet at a spa where they’ll charge you extra for a “callus removing treatment.” But $40 and a week later, the dry, hard skin will likely return with a vengeance. So we asked top foot experts for the best at-home remedy. And they agree: You can remove calluses easily with a baking soda foot soak.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What are calluses?</strong></h2><p>The dry, hard and often thick patches of foot skin are a result of an accumulation of keratin, a protein produced by skin to protect it against friction. Repeated friction on sensitive areas of the feet causes skin to form this hard protective layer of keratin. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Calluses</a>, which can appear on the sides of toes and bottoms of soles tend to get worse with each passing year because of moisture loss in skin as we age, says podiatrist <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Suzanne Levine, D.P.M.</a></p><p>And the patches of thick skin are notoriously difficult to get rid of. Unlike traditional removal methods that use harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbing techniques to treat calluses, mildly exfoliating and moisturizing baking soda soaks are gentle, natural and effective at removing the rough patches – for good!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Why is a baking soda foot soak effective at removing calluses?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/shutterstock_179857913.jpg><p>Baking soda (or sodium bicarbonate) has a&nbsp;<a href=#>variety of uses</a>&nbsp;when it comes to skincare. Some people mix it with equal parts water and use it as a spot treatment to eliminate stubborn acne or massage it onto damp skin to nix flakiness. “Unlike many common chemical exfoliants, <a href=#>baking soda</a> is not acidic or rough, so it’s the perfect exfoliant for sensitive skin,” says <a href=#>Ted Lain</a>, M.D., a dermatologist in Austin, Texas. “It won’t cause scratches or burning.” Instead, the exfoliating powder gently whisks away dead cells while balancing skin’s pH to relieve dryness that comes along with issues like parched and flaky or callused skin.</p><p>Relaxing in a baking soda foot bath will help to soften hard, dry calluses and reduce their appearance over time, and is a much easier method than painfully scrubbing away at them with an abrasive pumice stone or foot file.</p><p>Even better? Because of its alkaline in nature, the white powder helps <a href=#>neutralize foot odor </a>while also absorbing sweat – like a detox for your feet so they’ll smell fresh too!</p><p>One caveat: Using baking soda on your skin may cause redness and irritation. Always dilute it before using it in your skincare, and perform a test patch of your solution on your skin to check for adverse reactions.

Once you’re done with your foot soak, towel-dry your feet and apply a cream containing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ammonium lactate </a>(which exfoliates), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ceramides</a> (which restore skin’s moisture barrier) and<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> hyaluronic acid</a> (a powerful humectant). One we like: CeraVe Renewing SA Foot Cream, (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $21</a>).<strong></strong></p><p>For best results, do twice a week.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What else can I add to a baking soda soak for calluses?</strong></h2><p>In addition to baking soda, you can try mixing in different natural ingredients that will help boost the skin-softening benefits of your relaxing foot bath. For example, try stirring 1 cup of warm milk into your baking soda foot soak. Lipid-rich milk is a natural hydrator for tough, dry skin, and it contains lactic acid—another mild <a href=#>exfoliator</a> that will help reveal soft and smooth skin underneath the callused areas. Other options: Stir in 1 cup of coconut milk (its fatty acids moisturize and gently melt away the hard layers of skin) or 3 Tbs. of honey (its humectant properties draw moisture into skin to further hydrate and soften feet).</p><p>This YouTube video shows the easy how-to!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.
