It would reportedly also feature Jax' wife <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong></a> and their child, as well as fellow oustered cast-member <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a>.</p><p>"I'm here to drink, take pictures and talk Vanderpump, and let's do that for a minute, talk Vanderpump, let's just say, I will bring it," Jax told partygoers at Ocean's Resort, per <a href=#><strong>US Weekly</strong></a>. "I will bring it to the people it needs to be brought to. Oh, I said too much, sorry!"</p><p>He didn't look too sorry, though, smiling and having a good time, per an insider for the outlet.</p><p>Perhaps "Pump Rules" is considering a backdoor pilot type of approach to its upcoming spinoff. The OG cast members could return to the parent series before spinning off into their own stories. And considering they're all still friends, for the most part, we would expect plenty of crossovers from the club scene to the crib scene.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c1d7708d-4159-4c25-98f5-d761c35ecf03 data-container-ref=toofab:article:5c8cb1fe-c209-4d39-8225-386a6ff63154 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f0/5by4/2023/06/24/f0eb98032dc64d96888ae2ef55ec9b54_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tom Schwartz Admits He's 'Slightly Terrified' to Film Vanderpump Rules Season 11</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Or it could be that Jax is referring to the spinoff, which would still be part of the "Pump Rules" universe.</p><p>Season 11 just kicked off filming, with footage from TomTom featuring several cast members including <a href=#><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Lala Kent</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>James Kennedy</strong></a>, and Ally Lewber. While there's no sign of Jax, he could still show up.</p><p>Also notably absent were TomTom co-owner, with Schwartz, <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>, the two central figures (aside from Ariana Madix) in the cheating "Scandoval" that blew up across the nation.</p><p>Raquel is reportedly still in treatment after having checked herself in for mental health reasons after admitting she and Sandoval continued to lie about their relationship timeline at the reunion. Sandoval is currently filming Season 2 of Fox's "Special Forces." In truth, a bit of a break from those two and the rest of the cast is probably a good idea.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:55c0854f-5b34-4b1c-b584-8d0210bb0c0e data-container-ref=toofab:article:5c8cb1fe-c209-4d39-8225-386a6ff63154 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/45/5by4/2023/06/23/45e00b7e90c94998a869d0e44931947a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Stassi Schroeder Still 'Can't Trust' Jax Taylor & Brittany Cartwright After Wedding Drama</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Jax and Brittany left the show in 2020 as she was pregnant with their first child. Also booted at the time were Kristen and <a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong></a>, for filing a false police report against former cast member Faith Stowers, as well as accusations of making racist comments. Stassi is reportedly not part of the proposed spinoff.</p><p>Jax also tweeted that she had committed a crime, but his and Brittany's departure was somewhat muddier as the couple both implied it was their decision to go, and that Bravo had perhaps had some say in their departure statement.</p><p>Despite having departed the show, Jax and Brittany had plenty to say about the "Scandoval," talking about it extensively on social media and various podcats, as well as for Peacock's "Watch Me." The couple did say they enjoyed the latter project and enjoyed having cameras and crew around again, hinting further at a return to reality TV.</p><a id=gallery-link-38a90fcb-55ac-4efd-bb27-e2fecc387f43 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:38a90fcb-55ac-4efd-bb27-e2fecc387f43 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:5c8cb1fe-c209-4d39-8225-386a6ff63154 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a7/4by3/2023/07/07/a787facccb67437dab36c27b4fc1d534_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmaWpfn665edOasKWnomKupK%2FInZynrJGhubp50qWgqWWmlrulsdGprKaoXafCrbHSZqmerKWnu3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
