The Today co-host, who has been working virtually from her upstate New York home with husband Michael Feldman and their kids, daughter Vale, 5, and son Charley, 3, tells PEOPLE that a few things went wrong for the holiday this year. For starters, the family of four had to use a substitution when dyeing the Easter eggs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It worked great.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The mother of two also revealed that her Today co-host and close friend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hoda Kotb</a> gave her some helpful advice for her kids’ egg hunt — or so she thought.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Savannah Guthrie/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Hoda gave me a ‘foolproof’ idea for hard boiling eggs, which it turns out was not foolproof because my eggs were all soft boiled,” Guthrie says. “When the Easter bunny hid them outside, some of them blew off the ledge of the fence and I had cracked eggs all over my porch.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE’s free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the mishaps, Guthrie and her family still managed to enjoy the holiday together. “We watched church online, which was really sweet, very tender and then the kids got Easter baskets,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Then we had a great time. We had a family dinner and it was beautiful,” she adds. “It was special. It was different, but it was special and we were counting blessings.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And luckily for Charley and Vale, their famous mom got creative with the Easter baskets this time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I tried to not just do candy in their baskets,” she explains. “Charley got a little plastic rake and a shovel and Vale got some bubbles and they both got a little soccer ball and a little basketball, but it was mostly candy, which I proceeded to eat.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Vale and Charley.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Savannah Guthrie/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier last month, Guthrie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>worked from home</a> for almost two weeks out of an abundance of caution after coming down with a mild sore throat and runny nose amid the COVID-19 outbreak. But after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>briefly returning</a> to the studio earlier this month, Guthrie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>went back</a> to anchoring from home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m home. My family is upstate, and so I’m sticking close to the family and coming to the city less and less,” Guthrie said on Today broadcast last Monday. “So I’m trying to work from home. And also, frankly, that’s what these officials are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>telling us to do</a>, so that’s exactly what I’m going to do.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You’re doing all the right things,” Kotb replied.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>As information about the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>coronavirus pandemic</a> rapidly changes, PEOPLE is committed to providing the most recent data in our coverage.
