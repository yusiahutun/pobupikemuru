“She is probably among the strongest most optimistic people I’ve ever met, because she believes anything is possible,” Hoda once said on Today about her supportive mother."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She’s a mom to kids <a href=#>Hope Catherine</a> and <a href=#>Haley Joy</a> and she has an amazing support system at home. When the <a href=#>Today</a> costar and her fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Joel Schiffman</strong></a>, are too busy to look after the children, they can always rely on Hoda’s mom, <a href=#><strong>Sameha Kotb</strong></a>.</p><p>“She is probably among the strongest most optimistic people I’ve ever met, because she believes anything is possible,” Hoda once said on <a href=#>Today</a> about her supportive mother. “And when she looks at me and says, ‘You can do it,’ I honestly believe I can. If I said to her at 51 years old, ‘You know what, Mom, I’m thinking about being a mountain climber, or maybe I’ll go to the moon,’ she’ll be like, ‘Yes, of course! Are there classes?’”</p><p>Sameha is not the only great person in Hoda’s life. She also adores her man, who has stood by her side through thick and thin. In January 2020, the couple made their love official when Joel asked Hoda to be his wife. “He goes, ‘I’d like to say something.’ It was just the two of us, and he started talking and I looked at him thinking, Oh my god, this is going somewhere,'” the TV personality recalled about Joel’s<a href=#> romantic beach proposal.</a></p><p>“He literally kicked the seat out from under him and dropped down on one knee,” she continued. “I didn’t know I could be shocked, and I didn’t know I could love him more … but I did … in that moment.”</p><p>Since the pair became engaged, Hoda’s been <a href=#>feeling like everything is right</a> with the world. The NBC star once told <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> she feels like she has “clarity” because of her beautiful family at home. When she comes home from a long day of work, Haley would jump into her arms and Hope would smile at her.</p><p>“I feel like my life finally makes sense,” Hoda gushed, and she wouldn’t want to have it any other way.</p><p><strong>Scroll on down below to learn about Hoda’s family!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hpp2ZXaC8ta7SZp2apZmhxm6tjKCsopyVYsGweceeqWavn6Oxpr7FrqNmpJ%2BrsqV5zqecrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
