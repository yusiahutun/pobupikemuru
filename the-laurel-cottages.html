If you would’ve told me 10 years ago that in 2018 our life would look like this:
We would have a nearly 5-year-old precious, baby girl getting ready to start Kindergarten in one of our city schools  Laurel would start filming it’s 3rd season of a home restoration show on HGTV Downtown Laurel would be a vacation destination We would own a retail store that sells only USA-made items (not to mention, in a building that was one of the worst buildings in downtown) We would have our house on this bed and breakfast website that allowed people from all around the globe to book a night’s stay at our house and Airstream (even just the fact that we have a RV!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I mean….guys, I don’t know how I can accurately quantify just how weird and amazing the last ten years have been for Laurel, for our framily (the Rasberrys/Napiers/Nowells) and for all the folks that have been knee deep in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laurel’s comeback story</a> for years. It’s been an incredible, life changing story and I have a feeling that there will be even more “omg, I can’t believe that happened” moments to gasp at in the next ten years!</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>Back in 2015 we started the Airbnb journey at our previous home. Nearly all the homes in the historic district have a small, separate “mother-in-law suite” cottage in the back yard. For decades, folks have used these dwellings as rentals – but all long-term tenants. When we renovated our first home, we had an adorable little cottage in the back just like every other house on our street – and that’s where this story started. We were actually the first Laurel property on Airbnb and quickly realized our love for hosting folks visiting our hometown.</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>&nbsp;Fast forward to 2018, we’ve moved to a new house, have 2 properties on Airbnb,&nbsp;about to add a 3rd.... and&nbsp;Laurel now&nbsp;has almost 15 available properties on Airbnb and ALL of them are AMAZING!&nbsp;I’m so dang proud of the folks that have stepped up and taken the plunge to host. And here’s why:</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>For the past 10 years we’ve all sat around many a board room table dreaming up strategies and ideas to make folks want to visit our City Beautiful. We’ve hosted events, we’ve ran marketing campaigns, completed&nbsp;lighting projects, restored buildings and houses,&nbsp;opened up businesses, agreed to be on a TV show…..you name it, we’ve done it.</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>And what we’ve found is that when we host a family at the cottage, no matter if they are from north Georgia or North Dakota, it brings the last 10 years of our dream to real life. With each check in of a guest, we see the&nbsp;real result of everyone's hard work.&nbsp;Grassroots&nbsp;economic development at it's finest.</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>&nbsp;For example, when I am cleaning up after our guests, getting ready for the next one…you know what I find 100% of the time?</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>I find&nbsp;empty take out boxes from Mimmo’s, empty cups from Lee’s Coffee, empty cupcake wrappers from Sweet Somethings Bakery and empty bags from all our shops.</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>&nbsp;Folks are coming to Laurel, spending their time and money in downtown visiting the Museum, shopping at our shops, walking underneath the lights from our lighting project, eating at our restaurants…..and they LOVE it.&nbsp; They are having the time of their lives, right where we have the incredible gift of living our life daily. Perhaps, that’s my favorite part of it all….our guests come to Laurel searching for a glimpse of the small town, American dream that they may have seen on TV…they get just that&nbsp;but they don’t even realize how big of a role they are actually playing in that dream.</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>&nbsp;Our hope is that each person that visits Laurel&nbsp;leaves inspired, optimistic and thankful for their own hometown and goes back home to make a difference. Because they sure are making a difference here in Laurel, even if they realize it or not.&nbsp;</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>There have been a lot of folks working hard to prepare for them,waiting patiently for a long while now....and we can't wait to say "Welcome to Laurel".&nbsp;</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>&nbsp;Book your stay at the Laurel Cottages directly&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>&nbsp;or through <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AirBnb</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HomeAway</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=m_-9113115234821804663x_MsoNormal><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/unnamed_756772b6-fbce-4021-8c3b-e9b0497cbcab.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Mallorie graduated from the University of Mississippi in 2008 with a Bachelor of Accountancy&nbsp;and immediately followed with&nbsp;a&nbsp;Master&nbsp;of&nbsp;Accountancy and passing the Certified Public Accountant exam.&nbsp;</p><p>Mallorie worked for KPMG and a large regional accounting firm before taking root in Laurel, MS helping run the family businesses, Rasberry Producer Group and Rasberry Financial Services. &nbsp;</p><p>They also co-own and manage their retail store, the Laurel Mercantile. In 2016 a partnership was formed between the Napiers, Nowells and Rasberrys, 3 couples made up of family and long-time best friends.
