According to the source, Otto arrived earlier this summer, a fact that was expertly hidden from the public and media. The insider noted that the new mama's signature outfit formula (black and oversized everything) certainly didn't hurt in keeping the pregnancy private. Plus, she and Eisner spent a lot of time in the Hamptons, away from the hustle and bustle (and prying eyes) of NYC.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, her family and twin sister Mary-Kate knew about the pregnancy, and they were all "beyond excited to have a new addition to the family." Although their lives have been very untraditional between their child stardom and high-end fashion label The Row, another insider added that "having a family has always been a priority for Ashley and Louis."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even though her upbringing was anything but typical, she does like some of the more traditional things," the source said, "For example, they wanted to be married first before starting a family."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Olsen and Eisner wed</a> in a very intimate ceremony last year, which they unsurprisingly kept private from the outside world. According to Page Six, the couple tied the knot at a Bel-Air home in late December of 2022.
