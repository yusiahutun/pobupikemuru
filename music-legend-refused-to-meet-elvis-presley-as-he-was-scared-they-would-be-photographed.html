Even if they’ve put on weight,” he said laughing.</p><p>This earned a laugh from Alison. She joked: “Should’ve never put it off, just because they’re a little bit heavier. Is that why you don’t want me at your house? Anyway …”</p><p>People were quick to react on X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) to the 83-year-old’s interview.</p><p>Another wrote: “Every single fat woman can give you at least 5 instances like the one Cliff Richard just subjected Alison Hammond to, and each time they probably laughed it off. I know I did. Because they’re not talking about you, right? Serious respect to Alison for refusing to play that game.”</p><p>“Who the hell does Cliff Richard think he is, not wanting a photo with Elvis because Elvis had put on weight? Alison Hammond gave a quick response. How bloody rude,” said one person.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-not-knowing-much-about-elvis>Not knowing much about Elvis</h2><p>Elvis was portrayed in Baz Luhrmann’s biopic last year by Austin Butler and is again returning to the big screen. This time, however, he will be played by Euphoria star Jacob Elordi.</p><p>However, the 26-year-old didn’t know much about the singer before playing him in Sofia Coppola’s <a href=#>Priscilla</a>. The Australian native <a href=#>learned about Elvis from Disney’s Lilo and Stitch</a>.</p><p>He told Jimmy Fallon: “The most I knew of Elvis was in Lilo and Stitch” and said that the idea of playing the Jailhouse Rock singer was “terrifying.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2d%2FcLnUrKCcZZyatKa6w2apnp6lqLKledOoZKadlal6prjVoqpmqKKawK2x2GaYrGWYmnq4rdJmqpyZopqxbsDHnrBmr5%2BquaV5wZ5kqaCfqbyovsCpn56cXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
