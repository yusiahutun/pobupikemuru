Don’t give up hope, though: Whether you want support without altering your natural cleavage or you’re looking to push your boobs in and up, we found many bras out there that are amazing for East/West chests.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We conducted a ton of research and spoke to bra fitting pros to find out what exactly makes a bra a good fit for those with wide-set breasts, and the answer is that you have options, baby. Racerbacks, front closures, push-up cups and side support can all make a huge difference to how comfortable a bra feels for you, and all can provide the look you want. Combine some of these features together and you can be pretty sure you’ll have found your new favorite bra. Speaking of which, here are some of our new favorites.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-thirdlove-247-classic-uplift-plunge-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Thirdlove 24/7 Classic Uplift Plunge Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ThirdLove 24/7 Classic Uplift Plunge Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Zj9-2W_lnJ0ObOTHoDHBcKw6bF0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ThirdLove-24-7-Classic-Uplift-Plunge-Bra-9dd9d0f275c944c9a15c9b97b5af7fa2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ThirdLove</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This is the bra for those who want support without altering their natural cleavage.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The lace can feel scratchy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is so many people’s favorite bra — and that includes those with wide-set breasts. This is the perfect pick for you if you want to feel supported, but you don’t want to alter the natural look of your cleavage too much: The design holds everything in without smooshing your boobs together unnecessarily. It also gives you just enough lift and shaping to feel comfortable and look flattering, plus it’s a sexy plunge style, ideal for wearing under low-cut clothes. This bra comes in half sizes, the cups are made from memory foam and contain removable inserts, and the straps are adjustable, so you can rest assured you’ll get a perfect fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We absolutely love those cute colorways, especially the apple candy green and lilac. It’s great that it comes in lacey options as well for upping that sexiness factor, but sadly some people find the lace scratchy, which is sub-ideal. Thankfully this bra is tagless, so that’s one less potentially scratchy feature to worry about.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32AA-44H | <strong>Colors</strong>: 12 |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex |<strong> Lining: </strong>Yes |<strong> Padding: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-maidenform-love-the-lift-push-up-underwire-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maidenform Push Up Underwire Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Maidenform Love the Lift Push Up Underwire Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0fTz0LBmqp_d3WI0W7sqbHxL2q4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Maidenform-Love-the-Lift-Push-Up-Underwire-Bra-2d9c73fe5373461aa98d501bc054760f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It pushes your breasts up and in.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is a truly great bra, and not just for the price. “Maidenform’s Love the Lift range is perfect for wide-set breasts,” says UK-based stylist Emma Lightbown. “Not only do they give you lift, but they also gently push [you] in from the side — they have a fabulous collection of colors and styles all built to bring your breasts together.” The expert has a point: This bra has the widest range of colors of any bra on our list, so you can opt for a simple smooth cup or a lace-embellished one in neutral black or beige, or in exciting teal or crimson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for this bra’s construction, it’s a push-up style for enhancing your cleavage, which also features an underwire for extra support. The bra can be worn in a criss-cross style to further bring your breasts together if that’s your goal here. You just may need to size up for a better fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32A-40D | <strong>Colors</strong>: 18 |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex |<strong> Lining: </strong>No |<strong> Padding: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-aubade-softessence-underwired-triangle-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aubade Underwired Triangle Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aubade SOFTESSENCE Underwired Triangle Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0xRQwd-mkTz2rXtOkC7tDUdpp1A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Aubade-SOFTESSENCE-Underwired-Triangle-Bra-e6f94045a0b14621ae687b8b07f55b6b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This beautiful bra helps to bring your breasts forward.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Nipples will show through, so it’s not for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A triangle bra is another fantastic option for wide-set breasts in general, but this luxury pick from Aubade is especially worth the investment. First of all, it looks absolutely beautiful (though, yes, it will show your nipples — so take note if that’s not your speed), thanks to soft lace, tulle lining, scalloped straps, and a plunging neckline.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Second of all, the Softsense material “shapes, supports, and centers the breasts, bringing them forward rather than outward,” says Sapna Palep, the CEO of multi-brand lingerie retailer Journelle. That’s because of side support, which helps to reduce the gap between your breasts and hold you in. We also love that it’s made from part recycled materials, and that it comes in two basic colors plus a teal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>30C-40D | <strong>Colors</strong>: Black, beige, turquoise |<strong> Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane, polyester |<strong> Lining: </strong>Yes |<strong> Padding: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-elomi-matilda-side-support-plunge-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Elomi Side Support Plunge Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Elomi Matilda Side Support Plunge Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YHsKiBs-g5elhRgbohNsTeCrmY4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Elomi-Matilda-Side-Support-Plunge-Bra-06b0bcaec0c04fa88235a4cc58480e69.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The side support and racerback option help breasts sit forward and up.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some people find the fabric scratchy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A brand created for band sizes up to 46, Elomi is a go-to for plus-size bras that are actually sexy. According to Courtney Killpack, CEO of Bra Fittings by Court, the Matilda is “for those who want a plunge style that gives a great minimized shape.” It features a “racerback clip option in the back, mesh that smooths out nipples so you can't see them poking through, and a smaller, shorter gore (the middle piece that sits between the breasts and allows people to wear lower cut shirts).” The straps are also wide enough to provide the support you need if you have fuller breasts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s not just the pros, though: Customers love this design so much that many of them collect it in a selection of colorways — because it comes in great neutrals as well as a fierce leopard or a pretty berry, to call out a couple. Each of these features a sheer mesh panel at the top of the cup and lacy embellishments, but some people do find that fabric scratchy. Still, for those with wide-set breasts, the side support panel as well as the J hook in the back are especially welcome for helping the breasts sit forward and up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32GG-46DD | <strong>Colors</strong>: 15 |<strong> Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane, polyester |<strong> Lining: </strong>No |<strong> Padding: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-small-breasts-knix-lace-racerback-bralette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Small Breasts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Knix Lace Racerback Bralette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Knix Lace Racerback Bralette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uH6CTBlgSpyWp6KXpiXYozcBw5I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Knix-Lace-Racerback-Bralette-942d839f21ec4b80ae5dbd68292ff542.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Knix</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It fits bra sizes starting at 28A.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It fits a little tightly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Racerback styles are great for those with wide-set breasts who want their bra to push them forward slightly. This one features smooth lined and padded cups, adjustable straps, and a sweet lace detail in the back. It’s also wireless for added comfort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though people with larger band and cup sizes rave about the level of support this bralette gives them — especially considering it’s wire-free — we want to recognize Knix for making bras that fit sizes starting at a 28A, which is unfortunately really hard to find. This style comes in letter sizes (starting at XXS) so each size can <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fit a range of bra sizes</a>, which also takes the guessing game out of ordering the right size. No matter how small or large your breasts are, basically, nobody has a bad word to say about this design, except maybe that it fits a little tight and can be hard to take off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>28A-44G | <strong>Colors</strong>: 7 |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex |<strong> Lining: </strong>Yes |<strong> Padding: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-large-breasts-panache-ana-plunge-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Large Breasts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Panache Ana Plunge Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Panache Ana Plunge Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-giG6_8B5aMS_tirbFyIX-bbj9g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Panache-Ana-Plunge-Bra-f2a5b53ab4e5478fabd85fb5d685f517.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bravissimo</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The side support gently brings your breasts forward and up.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The straps are too far apart for narrow shoulders.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Designed for fuller cup sizes, this bra offers side support which helps center the breast tissue,” says Palep. Indeed, the cups are lined at the sides to help bring your breasts forward, and the inner side sling also helps contain wide-set chests, without creating a uni-boob look. Just keep in mind that the straps are a little far apart, so it’s more suitable for those with broad shoulders.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is a sexy number that comes in a great range of feminine and understated shades (with the exception of the electric blue), and features lace all over the cups and front band, plus a little satin bow and bead in the front to really bring home that this is a fashion bra as well as a functional one. It’s also a comfortable, supportive, and gently lifting garment — it’s kinda got it all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>28F-38J | <strong>Colors</strong>: 7 |<strong> Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane |<strong> Lining: </strong>Yes |<strong> Padding: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-shallow-breasts-btemptd-future-foundation-front-close-racerback-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Shallow Breasts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>b.tempt'd Front Close Racerback Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="b.tempt'd Future Foundation Front Close Racerback Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1pgeRfguP_DzfVwz6k7o4FyyW40=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/btemptd-Future-Foundation-Front-Close-Racerback-Bra-ab7038d0bc404ed69c6d813194289e53.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It molds to the shape of your breasts while also pushing them forward.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You may need to size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you have shallow on top breasts that are also wide-set, it gets doubly tricky to shop for bras off the rack — but don’t despair. Bras like this one from b.tempt’d by Wacoal will fit you like a glove, thanks to the lightweight stretch foam cups that mold to the shape of your breast and make unseemly gaping a thing of the past. As for the wide-set aspect, this design helps in two major ways: The racerback style and front closure both encourage the breast tissue forward, reducing the gap between your breasts if that’s what you’re looking to do. People do find this style snug when they take their regular size, though, so sizing up might be the move.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This pick looks great on many body types, and it’s also so comfortable and soft you’ll forget you’re even wearing a bra —&nbsp;even where the lace touches your skin since it’s not scratchy at all. The front closure also means that this bra is easy to put on and take off without having to reach behind you, because getting dressed shouldn’t feel like a chore.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32B-38DD | <strong>Colors</strong>: Night, rose smoke, purple impression |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex |<strong> Lining: </strong>No |<strong> Padding: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-push-up-huit-cupcake-push-up-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Push-Up</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Huit Cupcake Push-Up Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Huit Cupcake Push-Up Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zdyG5Nj6GMC5UXubH7VxqAEeOaE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Huit-Cupcake-Push-Up-Bra-a78af3bc0837444aa6fea1ef63b21a37.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Huit</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s so cute!</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The size range is tiny.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Push-up bras can also work for wide-set breasts,” explains Palep. “The push-up padding helps steer the breast tissue up and center rather than outward.” The expert recommends this absolutely adorable “Cupcake” bra that comes in navy or red, both of which are just as cute as each other with their scalloped cup and mesh design. This one is for those who want a serious push-up that will visibly enhance their cleavage — just as well, because the size range is the smallest on our list, and caters to very few bodies. Aside from that, this bra is a great pick for wide-set breasts because of its supportive underwire, molded cups, and adjustable straps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32B-36D | <strong>Colors</strong>: Navy, red |<strong> Material: </strong>Polyamide, polyester elastane |<strong> Lining: </strong>Yes |<strong> Padding: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wireless-cosabella-talco-curvy-racerback-bralette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wireless</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cosabella Talco Curvy Racerback Bralette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cosabella Talco Curvy Racerback Bralette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/td6bHYKe82VQ-w7p-DnT1dP8psg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cosabella-Talco-Curvy-Racerback-Bralette-ee2c1c541d3c498e892593c6aaab5f5c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s supportive but not constricting.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The clasp can be scratchy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve ever believed that those with fuller cups can’t wear bralettes, this Cosabella design is here to change your mind for good. “Designed for DD+ cups only, this comfy microfiber racerback wireless bralette style helps center breasts forward, with power mesh lining for added support,” explains Palep.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Racerbacks are a smart choice for wide-set breasts generally because they help to bring the breasts inwards rather than out. This one features wider straps to support you better but is wireless for that feeling of freedom — perfect for lounging, sleeping, or low-impact exercise. It’s made from a special viscose jersey that’s super soft, too. The only problem is that the clasp can scratch your back. With that said, the band doesn’t roll up and the style doesn’t create the dreaded uni-boob, which is a double win for a wireless bralette.

Montelle Intimates is coming through on that front, with this basic strapless design that’s constructed with padding for lifting your breasts, power mesh on the sides for bringing them forward, and silicone strips to guarantee a no-slipping-down situation. Some people actually find they even need to size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Foam cups help the bra fit to your breasts without gaping, and microfiber gives it a smooth look so it will disappear under your clothes. It also comes with optional straps in case you’re looking for a little extra hold, which means you can turn this one into a criss-cross style for even more support.

This one is also designed with a racerback style, which is another feature experts recommend for East/West boobs since it helps provide extra hold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fabric is a soft microfiber that will feel lovely on your skin, looks great, and is smooth enough not to show under your clothes — plus it fits perfectly without gaping. We’re loving the beautiful selection of neutrals this bra comes in, too. The band can run a little tight, so there’s a chance you’ll need to exchange it for a larger size, though many people do find it fits true to size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>30A-38G | <strong>Colors</strong>: 6 |<strong> Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane, polyester |<strong> Lining: </strong>Yes |<strong> Padding: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-full-coverage-elomi-morgan-stretch-banded-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Full Coverage</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Elomi Morgan Stretch Banded Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Elomi Morgan Stretch Banded Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iQ43BrxqFIbiBtgvOUgLK8N-u6M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Elomi-Morgan-Stretch-Banded-Bra-9cb04a4f333d4474b1c9c36bb577138c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s incredibly supportive all around.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You need to hand wash it to preserve the lace.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“For wider-set breasts, you'll want to go with a wider-shaped underwire — they will feel more comfortable,” says Killpack. For the expert, the Morgan is the perfect example of this. “It has an elastic lace top in the cup,” she explains. “This allows for a more custom fit for many breast shapes. This is full coverage and will give an amazing narrow shape, meaning your breasts will look more narrow and closer together. The ultimate minimizer.” It also has side support panels to further support you and avoid side boob action, but without creating a uni-boob.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The label on this bra says to hand wash it, and you should take heed if you don’t want the delicate lace to peel off of the garment. People think this extra piece of work is more than worth it, however, because this design creates the absolute perfect fit for larger cup sizes, thanks to all of the above plus the wider straps for hold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32GG-46DD | <strong>Colors</strong>: 11 |<strong> Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane, polyester |<strong> Lining: </strong>Yes |<strong> Padding: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-unlined-simone-prle-essentiel-multiposition-unlined-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Unlined</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Simone Pérèle Essentiel Multiposition Unlined Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Simone P&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;r&amp;Atilde;&amp;uml;le Essentiel Multiposition Unlined Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CR-CgbJqMlK_ML_p_ihue5FBjFs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Simone-Perele-Essentiel-Multiposition-Unlined-Bra-ae0916703ed2429f840378cd7e12cb97.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Journelle</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It can be worn many different ways thanks to multiposition straps.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s not exactly affordable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The French sure do know how to make a fantastique bra. This one is for anyone looking for the most basic of plunge T-shirt bras, but with the absolute perfect fit. Palep loves this particular design because of its multiposition feature, which means it “can be made into a racerback style as well as a halter,” she says. She also points out that the memory foam cup will mold to your breast shape to avoid gaping, and the smooth cups will provide a seamless fit, as well as an invisible look under clothing — the ultimate mark of a successful T-shirt bra. It’s just a shame it’s not exactly affordable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32B-40D | <strong>Colors</strong>: Black, peau rose, amaretto |<strong> Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane |<strong> Lining: </strong>No |<strong> Padding: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Lining</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For wide-set breasts as for any shape of breast, it’s important to consider whether you prefer a lined or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>unlined bra</a>.
