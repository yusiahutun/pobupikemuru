Both the skin fade and crew cut are easy to maintain so you won’t have to spend a lot of time on your hair every morning. Since the crew cut is generally short, you can make it different by paring with a skin fade which leaves the top part slightly longer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a1071b05ea4445cc.jpg><h3>Side part comb-over hairstyle</h3><p class=align-left>A comb-over hairstyle helps men attain a professional look while remaining stylish. The comb-over can be amazing for hiding bald patches. To make this style, comb damp hair and separate part of the hair closer to the hair to create a natural line. Then comb the long hair on the top sections backwards and allow to air dry.

While it may require serious styling and a bit of hair length on the top, an organic hair product that makes your hair damp can work wonders in maintaining the quiff. Shaped up quiff is perfect for kinky hair as it requires only hair clippers and rarely will it need any hair product. The kinky hair works best with shape up quiff hairstyles because it provides both volume and the vertical length that distinguishes the haircut. For a dapper look ask your barber to taper the back and leave the rest of your head with the buzzcut. Complete this classy look with a well-trimmed thick beard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs5ri7bhdgrdl.jpg><h3>Short haircuts for men</h3><p class=align-left>Most men prefer short haircuts because they are easy to maintain and creates a fresh look that suits all face shapes.

To recreate a fringe undercut hairstyle, allow your hair on the top section to fall on the forehead and combine that with an undercut.

Braiding your dreads into cornrows keeps them out of your face especially if they are very long. The cornrow effect also prevents the locs from having an ordinary look.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/912d9107534552fa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 latest Kenyan hairstyles for women to rock in 2022</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs17fg82ak0lrg.jpg><h2>High fade with curls</h2><p class=align-left>Are you looking for fresh fade haircut ideas?
