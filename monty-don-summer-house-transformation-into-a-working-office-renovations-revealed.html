Spending time outdoors in natural environments helps to soothe the nervous system, reduce stress levels and bring about feelings of calm and relaxation.&nbsp;</p><p id=euK-C3b1G2C data-wc=54>"This is largely down to the biophilia effect, the concept that as human beings our bodies and brains have evolved in and with natural environments, therefore we function better in them. When we are relaxed and happy we are able to think better, be more creative and our imagination can run wild and free."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/04a800a40cd4-monty-don-new.jpg><p id=euzkpg1eE_s data-wc=65>She explains: "Prolonged use of screens has been linked to shortened attention span, reduced cognitive function and even anxiety & depression, however, research shows that spending just 2 hours in nature a week can improve our physical and mental health. Whether we choose our garden, woodland, the beach or a local park, simply walking or sitting and immersing ourselves in nature can reap the benefits.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_BsByha1K data-wc=69>"Seratonin our ‘happy hormone’ increases when we spend time in fresh air and in particular when we come in contact with soil - no wonder gardeners are always so happy! We may be inspired by natural metaphors, perhaps the growth of a beautiful flower or the falling of leaves in autumn that spark our creative juices and birdsong is also beneficial to enhance our mood and boost our creativity."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
