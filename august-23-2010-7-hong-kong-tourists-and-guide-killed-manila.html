But he was dismissed in 2008 for alleged involvement in drug-related crimes and extortion, police said. He took the hostages in an attempt to demand his job back and to have his name cleared.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His body was seen slumped out of the shattered front door of the bus last night with a bullet wound to the head.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is most regrettable,” said Tsang who appeared close to tears during a press conference. “The way it was handled, particularly the outcome, I find is disappointing.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tsang said he had tried to call Philippine President Benigno Aquino but could not get through. “I hope the Philippines government can give me a full account of what happened,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thousands in Hong Kong watched as the hostage drama unfolded live on TV.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The tour group left the city for the Philippines on Friday and was originally scheduled to arrive home last night. Their tour company, Hong Thai Travel, became aware of the unfolding drama when the tour guide made a secret phone call to the company from the back of the bus, unknown to the gunman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/18/e211d37b-696d-491d-a89f-88e20f82c4f4_ba426350.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We immediately called our people there and were told the police and military had already reached there,” Hong Thai Travel general manager Susanna Lau Mei-sze said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Twenty-two Hong Kong tourists and three Filipinos were aboard the bus when Mendoza seized the vehicle demanding he be reinstated. He released nine people during police negotiations, including two Filipinos.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As negotiations to free the remaining hostages failed, Mendoza threatened to kill the hostages.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I shot two Chinese. I will finish them all if they do not stop,” Mendoza told Radio Mindanao Network about 10 hours into the drama. “I can see a lot of SWAT [special weapons and tactics police] coming in. I know they will kill me. They should all leave, because anytime I will do the same here.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Filipino driver of the bus escaped after cutting himself loose from handcuffs and screamed “Everybody is dead!” as he ran to safety.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The attempted storming of the bus after negotiations broke down turned into a debacle with commandos unable to get inside for more than an hour. They encircled the bus, smashed its windows and fired at it, but Mendoza shot back.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The crisis eventually ended when police threw tear gas inside the bus and fired again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/18/63cac3d3-4ef4-47a3-8fcf-b2aea16c2bf4_b8566003.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One woman Hong Kong survivor, whose husband was killed, demanded to know why Manila police came to their rescue so late. “It’s too late. Why were there no one to help us after so many hours?” she said at the scene of the siege. “We were in fear for so many hours. I find it really cruel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There were so many people on the bus - no one came to our rescue. Why?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said her husband was killed as he tried to stop Mendoza from attacking other passengers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He [her husband] was brave. He rushed out trying to stop the gunman from shooting. I didn’t know whether the gunman was dead or not, but there had been non-stop gunshots.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last night, she was looking for her three sons who were also on the bus, aged 14, 18, and 21, and whose conditions was not known.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I really wanted to hold my husband and die with him, but I thought of the children. So I have to protect myself.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aquino expressed condolences to the relatives of those killed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“With the rest of the Filipino people, I wish to offer our deepest condolences to the families of the victims whose lives were lost in the hostage situation,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/18/47d78e19-e22c-453e-b17d-fa269fbc41f3_78d1640c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The tactics of the police in not killing the gunman early in the drama were questioned after a photo of the gunman in full view in the open doorway of the bus became public.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Hong Kong, resident Kevin Chan said: “It’s a tragedy and a farce. Why did it take them so long to get into the bus? They’re not well disciplined and trained. Are they crazy?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">City University criminologist Dennis Wong Sing-wing said if the drama had occurred in the United States or on the mainland, the gunman would have been killed much earlier.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It may be due to cultural differences. Filipinos are more easygoing and peace-loving so that they tend not to adopt fierce action. If the same scenario happened in the US or China, snipers would have killed the gunman a long time ago,” Wong said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The negotiators might also have failed to assess the situation correctly, thinking it could be solved without force, as the gunman released a number of hostages.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawmaker James To Kun-sun said police seemed “a little slow” in breaking into the vehicle. Another lawmaker, Wong Yuk-man, said: “The Filipino police’s approach to the incident might be problematic. But the situation changed very suddenly. It may have been a shock for even the police, who were asked to kill.” The Hong Kong government has issued a black travel alert, warning against travel to the Philippines. Travel agents in the city will cancel all tours to Manila until further notice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Reuters, Agence France-Presse</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoqqibmZrBunvAq6uim5yafHR9lnFocmpflsKowdKtZGtrXWd9cnyMcGShp56ceqy7zaBkraelp7a0wNJmmKecXZzCqrDEZqKipJyasW65wKegpZk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
