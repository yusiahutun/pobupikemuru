The Financial Times created a short online game where you take on the role of an Uber driver. The idea is to make your $1000 mortgage within one week. Can you do it?</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The animated game poses different situations through a series of multiple-choice questions. You'll need to decide what to buy for your car, how you handle things like unruly customers, and take calls about chasing surge prices or other quick-money opportunities. It's meant to simulate what an average Uber driver in California goes through.</p><p>There's an easy mode and a difficult mode, and it's better to start with the easy one. For each decision, The Uber Game will tell you why it was the right or wrong choice. Sometimes, a choice you make now will affect you later in the week, so think about the long term. Getting to that $1000 mark will not be easy, and you'll learn some important money lessons along the way.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=payback-web-financial-simulator-to-learn-how-to-reduce-college-debts>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Payback</a> (Web): Financial Simulator to Learn How to Reduce College Debts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/learn-personal-finance-games-payback.jpg><p>Good personal finance management is about reducing debt and increasing wealth. For many Americans, college debts are the most significant arrears. Payback is an online game cum simulator to help students realize the various choices by which their college debt can increase or decrease.</p><p>The game takes you through the four years of life in college as a freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior. In each year, you will have to make multiple decisions like where you choose to stay, what you eat, how you pick your specializations, your daily routines, and friendly outings, and so on.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Payback will tell you the effect of each choice on your debt, as well as on your happiness, focus on studies, and social circle. The goal is to exit college with a debt that is less than the average annual salary at your first job while still being a well-rounded individual.</p><p>Answer the questions as honestly as you can, not based on trying to "win" the game, and you'll have a realistic picture of your eventual college debt. Feel free to play the game multiple times with different choices to learn how you can best reduce debt.</p><h2 id=euroinvestment-web-15-mini-games-to-learn-personal-finance>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EuroInvestment</a> (Web): 15 Mini-Games to Learn Personal Finance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/learn-personal-finance-games-euroinvestment.jpg><p>EuroInvestment is a project to promote financial literacy among adults in the European Union. While the focus is on Europeans, it's actually pretty basic and universal <a href=#>personal finance advice</a> and principles that anyone would benefit from.</p><p>The project is a set of 15 mini-games across three major categories: risk and credit, money and transactions, and planning and managing. The games are a series of interactive videos with quizzes. Each one has a short tutorial before you start and is generally intuitive to play.</p><p>The focus of EuroInvestment is on adults, not students or children.

If you'd prefer not to divulge that data, ProjectiFi is a privacy-friendly financial simulator to understand how to plan your money.</p><p>ProjectiFi starts by asking you what age to begin simulations from and an idea of your current financial situation in terms of savings, investments, debts, and other assets. Set up all of those, and then create a plan.</p><p>The plan&nbsp;considers factors like your expected retirement age, life expectancy, investment growth rate, dividend, and inflation. You'll also need to add all current and future income projections. If you're unsure what any of these terms mean, there's a handy&nbsp;explanation&nbsp;in each ProjectiFi element. It'll guide you through each step of adding debts, financial goals, and other money matters.</p><p>In the end, ProjectiFi presents you with a clear projection of your financial future, with everything like income, taxes, debt payments, and other info for every year of your life. You can see where your wealth and expenses will be if you continue with this plan in a neat chart. You can edit and adjust the plan to include new goals or expenses too.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The free version of ProjectiFi is good enough for most people to run a financial simulation of their future and get a decent financial plan going.</p><h2 id=personal-finance-management-requires-practice>Personal Finance Management Requires Practice</h2><p>The different games in this article teach you the basics of personal finance and how to handle money.
