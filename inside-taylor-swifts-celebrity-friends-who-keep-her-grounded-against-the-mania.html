From <a href=#>stepping out with friends</a> to going out to a <a href=#>private dinner</a> with her beau, the Grammy-winning star took a decade and a half to find that right balance of attention that she could allow in her private life.</p><p>But her global fame comes with a price that only she has to pay. The singer once shared how sometimes her friends did not invite her to events knowing there could be paparazzi and helped her out by not including her.</p><p>Taylor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a>: “Sometimes I don’t get invited to things because my friends know it’s going to be a hassle to take me.”</p><p><strong>No Way</strong>: <a href=#>Travis Kelce’s managers ‘concerned’ Taylor Swift mania and fame will ‘become too saturated’</a></p><p>She added: “I’ll find out that a group of my friends went out to dinner, but they wanted it to be a low-key night and not worry about people coming up to the table every other second and asking for autographs, so they didn’t invite me. I can understand that.”</p><p>While it can seem almost ‘rude’ for her friends not to invite her, Taylor understood their intention and took it as a protective measure to actually help her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1853686088-1024x682.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-closest-friend-who-called-her-only-friend>Taylor Swift’s closest friend who called her ‘only friend’</h2><p>Swifties claim that Taylor Swift is the <a href=#>ultimate bff to have to get over your heartbreaks</a>. The singer’s cherished friendships often get the limelight; many of her friends believing the Happiness crooner has been the rock during their not-so-happy moments.</p><p>Her closest friend Selena once called the hitmaker her ‘only friend’ in a dire time. “She was frustrated when I was frustrated; she was sad when I was sad,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow>revealed</a>.</p><p>”I think [my friends] visibly saw me in so much pain. And they didn’t want it for me but they—sorry—they never stopped loving me.”</p><p>The feeling is definitely mutual, as Tay never shied away from expressing her love for the Single Soon crooner. Beaming with pride, Tay once said: “The things that she’s overcome, the situations she’s risen above, it’s been a long time since we were friends and she’s the best. She’s just the best.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2Z9cLXNrKCdnV2prrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8G0ecKeo56aop7BunnFq6CeppSoeri0zmainp2gYrWmvoygqaitnpmypXnAoJiipqOperW0xGakmqaZlnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
