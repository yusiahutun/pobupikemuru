The profile kicks off by revealing that after <a href=#>Louis C.K. made his return to stand-up</a> at the Comedy Cellar in late 2018, Jones was the only comedian to stop performing there entirely. “I am at the age when I will get off the boat and get on another damn boat,” she explained.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck5h5q4ur001t3g67njpowh1r@published data-word-count=93>While Jones eventually returned to the club, her time away from it was because she just couldn’t support its decision to host C.K., who had <a href=#>admitted that multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against him were true</a> the year before. “I knew girls,” she told the Times, “and they got to walk into the club and see him talking to the owner. That ain’t cool.” She added that, while away from the Cellar, she performed more often at the Comic Strip on the Upper East Side, adding, “They took his picture down. Mine’s up.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck5h5u5cl001z3g679909fktk@published data-word-count=157>The profile is filled with other insights from Jones: She wants to host The Tonight Show “really bad” and be “the next Johnny Carson.” After a show in London 15 years ago, Kevin Hart told her “she would never make it big” — but he has since apologized for the remark. Finally, given the overload of <a href=#>online trolling and harassment</a> she received over her role in the last Ghostbusters film, Jones shared some unsurprising thoughts <a href=#>on the new Ghostbusters</a>. “It pissed me off,” she told the Times about how she felt after watching <a href=#>the trailer</a>. “It feels like: They did it wrong and we know you guys were upset about that little girls’ Ghostbusters, so we’re going to do it right now.” She added that she wishes she would have “rocked the boat” — but, given her long departure from the Cellar, it looks like we can expect Jones to do plenty of rocking from now on.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck5h69ogq00283g671qf4jfkf@published data-word-count=5>Read the full profile <a href=#>here</a>.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck5dyx94n00a1blye641v38wd@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Leslie Jones, Ebullient Time Traveler</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjzvozy61004s0cye09z36yva@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>10 of Leslie Jones’s Best SNL Sketches</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Leslie Jones Left the Club That Let Louis C.K.
