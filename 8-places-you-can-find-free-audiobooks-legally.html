Here are a number of places you can download Audiobooks legally, and for free. And they're not all public domain stuff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of the audiobook sites you can find on the internet let you download classic books in the public domain for free, but some sites have better quality books than others. We've rounded up some of the best of those sites, plus some ways you can get other kinds of audiobooks for free, too.</p><h2 id=project-gutenberg-amp-librivox>Project Gutenberg & LibriVox</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LibriVox.png><p><a href=#>Project Gutenberg</a> is a volunteer-run repository, started in 1971, that works to digitize and archive cultural work to encourage the distribution of eBooks. But they're not just about eBooks.&nbsp;Project Gutenberg also has an extensive library of <a href=#>human-read</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>computer-generated</a>&nbsp;(read by a computerized voice) audio books from the public domain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>LibriVox.org</a> is another volunteer-run initiative that aims to release public domain audiobooks. Volunteers read chapters of books, and then LibriVox releases that audio back into the public domain for anyone to download.</p><p>The two services work together, with most audiobooks available on Project Gutenberg coming from the LibriVox site. Each site does have some books the other doesn't have, so it's worth checking them both out. Both sites let you listen to books right on the website, subscribe by iTunes, or download the book to your device in various formats.</p><p>Since they use books no longer under copyright, most of the books on the sites were written before 1923. So keep that in mind when searching for something to listen to. And if you enjoy the service and like what they are doing, <a href=#>it's easy to volunteer if you have spare time</a> to read a chapter or two and be part of history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spotify>Spotify</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Spotify.png><p><a href=#>Spotify now has a playlist of audiobooks</a> added to its repertoire. Again, most of them are classic works in the public domain. They don't have near as many titles as sites like Project Gutenberg and LibriVox, but if you're already a Spotify user, access the books is super easy. Just hit up the playlist.</p><p>You can listen to audiobooks on Spotify with a free account, but you will have to listen to adds at the beginning of each title. If you subscribe to a premium account, you can listen without ads.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Spotify Free vs. Premium: Is it Worth Upgrading?</a></span></p><h2 id=newfixtion>NewFixtion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NewFiction.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>NewFixtion</a>&nbsp;is in a category all to itself. It doesn't have many titles, but what it does have are original stories delivered in daily episodes.&nbsp;Each episode is voiced by trained actors, which gives it a more rounded feeling. It's really more like listening to an old-time radio drama than simply having a book read to you.</p><p>You can't download titles from NewFixtion, though.
