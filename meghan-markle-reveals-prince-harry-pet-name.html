They are one loving couple," while another added: " OH MY goodness! That's the cutest thing! " The couple watched the show with the creator of the musical, Lin Manuel Miranda, who spoke about the "surreal" experience of watching it with the sixth-great grandson of King George III (who is a character in the show).

"You did try, but I said no," he joked to Lin.</p><p id=ep-hPmLg9KE7 data-wc=1><strong>READ: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Cabbage, Squeak, Wombat - see the adorable nicknames the royal family including Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton</a></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e-OnayHcMQDG data-wc=90>Lin later tweeted: "King George III's great-great-great-great-great-great grandson the Duke of Sussex sang a few bars tonight," with the wide-eye emoji.

Because I found it so amazing to watch how that plays versus here, and the response is so different but everyone loves it." The special performance of the show was held in support of HIV charity Sentebale, which was co-founded by Prince Harry.</p><p id=edWSiIcLTvZa data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Victoria Beckham and daughter Harper shock with new tattoos</a></strong></p><p id=eLoyU2hA82Yw data-wc=23></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
