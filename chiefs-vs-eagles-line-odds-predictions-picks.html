The reigning Super Bowl Champion <a class=ath_autolink data-id=46 href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> are slight favorites over the visiting <a class=ath_autolink data-id=54 href=#>Philadelphia Eagles</a>.</p><p>Kickoff is set for 8:15 p.m. ET on Monday at Arrowhead Stadium. The game will be televised on ABC, ESPN and ESPN2.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The Eagles come into the game on a three-game winning streak but will be an underdog for the first time this season. Both teams are coming off of their bye. The Chiefs have won four of the previous five meetings with the Eagles.</p><p>The bye week came at the perfect time for Philadelphia. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=yhzPJprUoEnfzPvf href=#>Jalen Hurts</a> has been dealing with knee pain for weeks and wearing a knee brace for the past few games. That hasn’t slowed him down, however. The Eagles offense is tied with the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=58 href=#>49ers</a> for third-most points per game (28), and Hurts has scored ten touchdowns over the previous three. But it won’t be easy as the Chiefs have one of the most formidable defenses in the NFL. They rank inside the top five in points per game (15.9) yards per game (288.2) and have only allowed 15 total touchdowns all season.</p><p>Philadelphia will be without tight end <a class=ath_autolink data-id=nykzWOzuJ0e0tBeu href=#>Dallas Goedert</a> after he suffered a fractured forearm in the win against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=39 href=#>Cowboys</a> two weeks ago.</p><p>Two-time MVP <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WWwiw0IQD5ozgrHf href=#>Patrick Mahomes</a> hasn’t been as extraordinary this season as he’s been in the past, but the Chiefs are still in the top ten in passing yards (2,384) and touchdowns (17). Philadelphia has been susceptible to the pass, allowing 2,313 passing yards and the third most passing touchdowns (19).</p><p>The Eagles’ run defense is one of the most dominant in recent memory. They’ve allowed just 597 rushing yards through nine games, 115 less than the second-ranked <a class=ath_autolink data-id=41 href=#>Lions</a> defense. The Chiefs run game has struggled this season, rushing for less than 100 yards in six of nine games and scoring just four rushing touchdowns.</p><p>The Eagles will likely have to lean on their run game, which ranks top ten in both rushing touchdowns and yards per game, to upset the Chiefs. In Kansas City’s only two losses, they allowed an average of 135.5 yards on the ground but just 168.5 through the air.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The team who comes out on top Monday Night will come down to two matchups: the Chiefs’ passing offense versus the Eagles’ porous secondary and the Eagles’ dominant run game versus the Chiefs’ run defense.</p><p>All&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">odds from BetMGM</a>.
