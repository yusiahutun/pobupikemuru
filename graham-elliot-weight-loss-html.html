Many fans often wonder, &#34;how much weight did Graham Elliot lose?&#34;
The renowned chef has an innate ability to collocate four-star cuisine with humor, insight, and unconventional creativity. 
With appreciation for food and passion for cooking, he even made it to the judges' panel on the Fox Network's popular competitive-cooking show, MasterChef, alongside Christina Tossi, Gordon Ramsay, and Joe Bastianich. 
And as his appreciation grew, so did his waistline."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That was when the chef decided he needed to make changes.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Did Graham Elliot Lose Weight?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It was not like the chef had done nothing about his weight. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For years, he had tested various imaginative diets, worked with a dozen personal trainers, and joined multiple gyms, but he didn't achieve the results he wanted.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He realized he had to do something extreme and opted to undergo <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">weight loss surgery</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He consulted with Vivek Prachand, an expert in minimally invasive abdominal surgery, and after many rounds of discussions and counseling, Elliot underwent obesity surgery in July 2013. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Besides surgery, the chef also introduced many <a href=# rel="follow noopener">changes in his life</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>One change was his eating habits. The chef eliminated bread, pasta, soda, and beer and refrained from having late-night burgers and snacks.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The chef now eats salmon or chicken with salad or vegetables, and deserts consist of fruits, not ice cream.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He also replaced the sugary treats&nbsp;with almonds and dried fruit in his dressing room on the&nbsp;MasterChef&nbsp;set. As for exercises, the chef worked out almost every day.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>And his hard work paid off. Nine months after his surgery, he lost a whopping 147 lbs.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Graham Elliot's Weight Loss Changes</h2><p>Before the weight loss, the judge had hypertension, gout and was in constant pain.</p><p>He also had to rely on a sleep apnea machine,&nbsp;which prevented him from leaning over to snuggle with his wife and kids.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And the most frustrating for him was his inability to run and play sports with his three young kids.</p><p>"I physically could not do things a father, husband, and parent should be able to do," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately for him, he reaped the benefits of his healthy transformation. He shared that he no longer needed to wear a seatbelt extender or relied on his machine to keep his airway open while he slept.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>His cholesterol levels had radically improved, and his blood pressure had returned to a normal level.&nbsp;</p><p>The chef believes the transformation also changed his personality.</p><p>He was more assertive, and no longer had fears of people calling him fat if he said something wrong. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He still joked around, but he was a little more in command in meetings.&nbsp;</p><p>But the best part for him was, without a doubt, being able to spend time with his kids and making them proud.&nbsp;</p><p>Elliot recalled they were all running around playing tag with his son's friends during his son Mylo's birthday. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His son told them that his father was the fastest and could beat them in a race. "That was awesome!" said the chef.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ%2BilrWiuYyeo6Whn6l6uLHIoJ%2BtZZykwLR6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
