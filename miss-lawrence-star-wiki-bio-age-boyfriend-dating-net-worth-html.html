So, it remains unclear if he is single or is dating a boyfriend.</p><p><img alt height=1092 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/celebrity/lawrence-washington-full.png width=455 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Caption: Lawrence Washington AKA</strong> &nbsp;<strong>MIss Lawrence has not revealed a thing about his dating life.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: bravotv.com</p><p>Well, Lawrance may be mum regarding his personal life, his professional life creates quite a buzz in the media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>MIss Lawrence's Work On RHOA:</h2><p>Miss Lawrence was the&nbsp;confidante and hair stylist for <a href=# rel=follow>Sheree Whitfield</a> on RHOA, and when he left the show, there were several claims by people regarding his departure from the show.</p><p>So he came forth to address the claims, and what better way to do that than to provide a statement to the media!</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview </a>back in September 2015, he was asked if he was an accessory to the straight women on the show. Replying to the query, he divulged,</p><p>Absolutely! Not everybody, I have genuine friendships with some of the girls, but I do know that most of it came out of convenience. Most of it came out of being the token gay. The go-to person, “Oh, I need a new word to say, I need some gay slang! How do I say, ‘Yaasss’?” All of that type of stuff.&nbsp; When you know better, you do better. With me, I'm moving in a different direction just with who I am. So I'm still friends with all the girls and I love them dearly. They'll do well.</p><p>Additionally, Lawrence shared the reason for leaving the show RHOA&nbsp;and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>,</p><p>“What I’m saying is, they need to be held accountable for the cultural appropriation and they need to understand how to respect our culture — what’s appropriate to say and what’s not. I can almost assure you that if a&nbsp;white man was on a reality show and he got upset with a Black woman and said, “Black bitch,” it would be a huge uproar across America,”&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>He continued,</p><p>“The one episode where&nbsp;Kenya Moore’s&nbsp;friend got beat up at&nbsp;Nene’s&nbsp;party, no one was held accountable, there was no real apology put in place. I knew then that was not a place to occupy my time. I knew that there’s no way I can call myself a social activist and be a real activist for my community on that show. I’m not angry with them; I just think they need to be educated.”</p><p>After Lawrance departed from RHOA, he went on to become the star of other mega hits, like "Star," "Fashion Queens," "Empire" and further; owns a salon in Buckhead, Georgia.</p><p>Moreover, Lawrence, who is currently 34 in age, is also a songwriter, singer, and&nbsp;recording artist and has released songs like "Closet Freak," "Over It" and "Don't Stop." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His hard work,&nbsp;dedication, and passion for the craft have paid him well&nbsp;as well; which is visible in his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a>, which dwells around&nbsp;$200 thousand.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><a href=# rel=follow>Stay with us</a> for the emerging updates on Miss Lawrence!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqaho6h6ra3Wq5ynm5ViwLWt0WauoqOZYq%2Bqu4yanp5lkqTGp77InqWdZZSWwaq6xmalnqxdrLyzwMdnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
