At the previous meeting, the owners of 16 unclean properties were scheduled to have a public hearing with the council on July 5. Of those, only seven were listed on the agenda, and two of those were deleted before the meeting began.</p><p>Scotsman Manufacturing Co. is an incoming wood-countertop and cutting-board manufacturing operation that is expected to employ 85 people. The council set a public hearing date of Aug. 2 for the owners of the following properties that have been deemed unclean and “a menace to the public health and safety of the community” by the Inspection Department:</p><ul><li>1516 North 3rd Ave., Cindy Pittman;</li><li>213 West 13th St., Eli Valadez Sr.;</li><li>Lot south of 119 North Maple St., Longbeard Properties LLC;</li><li>103 Walters Ave., Mitchell Asmar Jr.;</li><li>153 and 155 Chestnut St., Brenda Marcombe;</li><li>210 Flora Ave., Rose Bolton Estate/Daniel Magee;</li><li>166 Elm St., Show Me Investments LLC</li></ul><p>The following properties that had been deemed unclean were designated to be cleaned by city workers and the property owners billed for the cost of the work after public hearings last week:</p><ul><li>2216 Center Ave., Dee Nero LLC;</li><li>2332 Queensburg Ave., Johana Trosper;</li><li>620 Arco Lane, Thomas Lyons;</li><li>130 West 16th St., Dee Nero LLC;</li><li>1036 North 4th Ave., James Cox/Judith Hughes;</li><li>1709 South 11th Ave., Avatar LLC</li></ul><p>The council approved lot-cleaning assessments for 10 unclean properties ranging in cost from $142.50 to $1,015.</p><p>In the same meeting, the council also agreed to pay for hotel and travel expenses for Hadley and Shikinia Kennedy-Ward of the Inspection Department to attend the three-day Mississippi Association of Code Enforcement Conference in D’Iberville next month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcL%2FCqKuspZGjerG%2Bzqmcq6ypYrCtscCnnJ1lnqR6scHBpaCcZZiarrO1zaBkp52TmsC0rdGyZpqqpJ6wrbG%2BaXCdmWZusXF5j2prnGVhZrKlecCbbHJlYZt9eq3Cnp2ebZaXe6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
