This week the couple, who tied the knot in Las Vegas on January 29, 1958, celebrate their golden wedding anniversary after sharing half a century as man and wife.</p><p id=erMbTo33pEZ data-wc=92>Paul, the star of such classics as <i>Cool Hand Luke</i> and <i>Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid</i>, first met his future wife in 1953 when he was an aspiring actor working on a Broadway production of <i>Picnic</i> and she was an understudy. Although the hunky actor was already married - to first wife Jackie Witte, with whom he has a son and two daughters - he and Jackie were divorced and Paul went on to marry Joanne in the same year she was awarded an Oscar for <i>The Three Faces Of Eve</i>.</p><p id=eI-RXdqRVB9Y data-wc=36>As a wedding gift to her the blue-eyed screen star added to Joanne's collection of sherry glasses with a silver cup inscribed: "So you wound up with Apollo. If he's sometimes hard to swallow, use this."</p><p id=eY9RwV3p_XAe data-wc=57>While their careers took off, the couple stayed away from Hollywood to raise their three daughters - Elinor, Melissa and Claire - in a converted barn in Westport, Connecticut. They appeared in ten feature films together, including <i>Mr And Mrs Bridge</i>, while Paul also directed or produced his wife in four movies, notably 1968's Oscar-nominated <i>Rachel, Rachel</i>.</p><p id=e5U5iCA-HaSs data-wc=54>Joanne, who turns 78 next month, once described being married to Paul as: "Being married to the most considerate, romantic man". Her 83-year-old spouse adds: "We are very, very different people and yet somehow we fed off those varied differences, and instead of separating us, it has made the whole bond a lot stronger."</p><p id=ebma9TUtz3Ae data-wc=27>"Joanne has always given me unconditional support in all my choices and endeavours, and that includes my race car driving, which she deplores. To me, that's love."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/legacy/film/2008/01/29/newman-woodward-50/imgs/newman-woodward-3a.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/legacy/film/2008/01/29/newman-woodward-50/imgs/newman-woodward-2a.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/legacy/film/2008/01/29/newman-woodward-50/imgs/newman-woodward-1a.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2lwYGZ%2FeoOScW5pal%2Bjsri5wKdksKefmcSivsNmbGln</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
