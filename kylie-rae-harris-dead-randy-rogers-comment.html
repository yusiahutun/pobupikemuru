She was slated to play the Big Barn Music Festival in Taos on Thursday. The singer-songwriter was just 30 years old.</p><p>"She was a great person, and she made everybody feel welcomed and loved and cared for. She was a really bright shining light," Rogers tells Taste of Country by phone. "You know, she really was. I remember the first time I heard her sing, I’ll never forget it."</p><p><strong>Remembering the Country Artists Who Have Died in 2019:</strong></p><p>Harris released her most recent project, a self-titled EP, in March of 2019, and she was reflective about being in a better place in her life when Taste of Country debuted one of the new songs, "<a href=#>Big 'Ol Heartache</a>," in January.</p><p>“My twenties weren’t a walk in the park, a lot of that admittedly self-inflicted, but I grew a lot,” Harris said. “This project feels like the close of a real painful chapter and a welcome to whatever is next.”</p><p>Harris wrote another song on the EP, the poignant "<a href=#>Twenty Years From Now</a>," for her six-year-old daughter. The haunting song talks of her hopes that someday her daughter might&nbsp;understand the choices she'd made, no matter how they turned out.</p><p>“Getting to the age your parents were when you were a child brings a whole lot of perspective,” Harris said. “Parents are people. People make mistakes and being a parent is hard. I’m not always going to make the right choices, but I hope that when my daughter gets older, she’ll see that they were all made with love and the best of intentions.”</p><p>The 16-year-old driver of one of the other vehicles involved in Harris' accident also died, while a third driver walked away unscathed. Authorities supect alcohol contributed to the accident, but they have so far offered no further details about the investigation.</p><p><strong>These Country Singers Know Tragedy All Too Well:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpLGcnrJuvsCeZKGZoqe2tHnDnpidZaKWu6XFjKumoJ2iqHqku8ymnKesXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
