She would always tell my mum that I needed to study music because I had a talent. My mum tried to get me to attend singing lessons. I was impulsive but I always had a deep connection with music,” he told The Allison Hagendorf Show.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">How Damiano David joined Måneskin</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/28/bc6cffa4-6591-4ccc-a1ce-904fd4ae17c6_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Determined to make a career out of music, he approached two younger pupils he went to school with who had started a band and asked if he could join them.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">8 of the richest country music stars of 2023 – net worths, ranked</span></p></a></h3>According to <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Vogue Italia</span></a>, after convincing Victoria De Angelis and Thomas Raggi that he was not “too pop” for their band, the pair added him to the group. Ethan Torchio later joined after he answered an advert for a drummer on Facebook. The four became Måneskin, after the Danish word for “moonlight”.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/28/21cc62c1-2b6a-4e84-b8c4-408f7689ed1e_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More convinced than ever about where his future lay, David dropped out of high school in his second year to pursue music. “For years I was told I shouldn’t think about music. I should commit to something serious and be responsible. I didn’t enjoy school, being told what to do and not being able to express my intelligence,” he said in an interview with Il Messaggero Italia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While he had the blessing of his parents, the group found it difficult and started out busking on the streets of Rome.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Before Eurovision … when did Måneskin finally get famous?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/28/4cb52f34-90a7-4cf4-b4cc-89eb24f173f7_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">David was 18 when the group finished second in the 11th season of the Italian X Factor in 2017. The group further flexed their muscles by winning the Sanremo Music Festival in 2021, a stepping stone to winning the Eurovision Song Contest shortly after. It catapulted them to fame and their version of “Beggin’” by The Four Seasons went viral on TikTok.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Måneskin went on to tour the world, opening for The Rolling Stones and working with Iggy Pop and Dolly Parton.
