This was made easier by the fact that all the CAD files for the console were made publicly available. If you're facing shortages trying to get a hold of an official accessory, or just want to add extra functionality to your console, then we've got you covered.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Below you will find some of the most innovative designs being created, most of which are free to use!</p><h2 id=steam-deck-dock>1. Steam Deck Dock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/steam-deck-3D-print-dock-with-usb-hub.jpg><p>If you don't want to wait for the official Steam Deck dock to arrive, then try 3D printing this one available to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">download on Thingiverse</a>. Its gorgeous design will satisfy your aesthetic needs, while the room to plug in a USB hub is the real reason why you will want this fantastic accessory.</p><p>This design has space to store a USB-C hub underneath the dock, such as the Anker 341 Hub. Its popularity also means that the design is continuing to be fine-tuned in response to feedback from makers. For those with a smaller printing bed, you can also get a design that's spliced in half to fit. To top it all off, the maker includes a printable Steam Deck logo so that your DIY printout will look just as convincing as anything you can buy in-store.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=steam-deck-stand-with-vents>2. Steam Deck Stand With Vents</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/steam-deck-3D-print-printables-stand-with-vents.png><p>This stand for your Steam Deck clips on easily and has convenient cutouts to allow airflow through the console vents. Its clean and minimal design is just what you want to display your Steam Deck in your home, and it costs so little to make too.</p><p>People have described it as secure and stable, with a great display angle as well. It cleverly locks into place using two screw holes at the back of the console for a snug fit. Depending on the settings, it can print in about one to four hours and costs less than $1 to make. Head to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Printables download page</a> to get the files for free, and while there, make sure to browse through the numerous community makes for added printing advice.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=clip-on-stand-for-the-steam-deck>3. Clip-On Stand for the Steam Deck</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/steam-deck-3D-print-accessories-printables-clip-on-stand.jpg><p>Releasing the CAD files for the Steam Deck meant that anyone with a 3D printer could create the perfect accessory for their needs. In this case, the maker wanted to use their Steam Deck in tabletop mode, similar to what can be done on a Nintendo Switch. The result is a highly functional stand that can be clipped on and off to hold the Steam Deck upright.</p><p>A handy, pull-out flap makes it easy to go from tabletop gaming to handheld, without having to remove the entire stand. However, if you did want to remove it, it shouldn't cause scratches and its thin design will make for easy storage. The only extra parts you need for assembly are a couple of small flathead screws. It won't fit inside the Steam carry case while clipped on, but the slick design more than makes up for this. Read more about this design and grab the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">files on Printables</a> to try it out yourself.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=hdd-and-ssd-storage-extender-for-the-steam-deck>4. HDD and SSD Storage Extender for the Steam Deck</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/steam-deck-3D-print-accessory-SDD-HDD-storage-extender.jpg><p>Sometimes a commercial solution just doesn't work for you, and you need to custom-build your idea, such as this storage extender. You could buy large SD cards, but for this DIY maker, it wasn't going to cut it for large gaming titles. Instead, they designed a clip-on extender to hold a standard HDD or SSD.</p><p>For those of you wondering what to do with an old HDD, this is a great use. Essentially, the 3D printed chassis has room for an HDD/SSD and a place for a USB-C hub to provide the right connection ports. While it's not the most beautiful-looking attachment, it does provide a specific solution for adding external storage. Take a look at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">files on CGTrader</a> to see if it's something you need, or use it as inspiration for your own design.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=steam-deck-cable-relief-attachment>5. Steam Deck Cable Relief Attachment</h2><p>Are you the type of person to have long gaming sessions into the early hours of the morning? Then this cable relief attachment is for you.</p><p>It's a practical accessory that will keep your cables and ports from deteriorating under the stress of using your Steam Deck over a long period of time. The simple design also makes room for the cooling vents and simply clips into place. And if you're not convinced, just take a look at the YouTube video to get an idea of its strength. There's not much else to it, so grab the files to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">download from Thingiverse</a> and give it a try.</p><p>If you want to find more 3D printing designs or upload your own, there are several other <a href=#>websites you can explore for free 3D printing files</a>.</p><h2 id=steam-deck-usb-c-charger-cradle>6. Steam Deck USB-C Charger Cradle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/steam-deck-3d-print-accessory-cable-case.jpg><p>Cable management isn't the most fun topic, so you would be surprised at the popularity of this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cable case on Printables</a>. The design includes a sliding lid to reveal enough space to store your Steam Deck charging cable plus an adapter, and extra slots to hold an additional four SD cards.</p><p>All of this conveniently fits into the bottom of the official Steam Deck carry case and makes organizing your peripherals just a tad bit easier. Since uploading the design, the maker has made a few extra versions with larger storage space for those who have trouble fitting the cable in neatly. The original printing files were made for the US adapter, with later versions being published for those of you using a European plug.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Some people might find that it's just too much hassle winding up the cable tight enough to fit in the case. But for others, it's proven to be exactly what they need, especially when porting the console around.</p><h2 id=steam-deck-repair-jig>7. Steam Deck Repair Jig</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/steam-deck-3D-print-repair-jig.jpg><p>This 3D printed repair jig might come in handy since nearly every part of the Steam Deck is user replaceable, so you can repair it at home with genuine <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">replacement parts from iFixit</a>. That's where this 3D printed design will be useful.</p><p>This repair jig is intended to hold the Steam Deck in place while you carry out delicate repairs on internal components. The maker notes that it's similar in design to the one used in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iFixit's YouTube teardown video</a>. If you see yourself making repairs in the future, keep a bookmark of this handy tool which you can <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">download from Printables</a>.</p><h2 id=designed-by-you-3d-printed-steam-deck-accessories>Designed by You: 3D Printed Steam Deck Accessories</h2><p>As more people start gaming with the Steam Deck, it's almost certain that we'll see more 3D printed designs.
