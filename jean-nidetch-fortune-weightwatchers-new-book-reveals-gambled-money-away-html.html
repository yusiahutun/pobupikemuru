She was spotted by a neighbour who came over to gushingly compliment her on her ‘marvellous’ appearance.
‘When are you due?’ she asked.
But there was no baby: at 5ft 7in and weighing a hefty 15st, 38-year-old Jean was simply vastly overweight."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For within two years of starting her weight loss journey, Nidetch had launched her own company.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Its name? Weight Watchers International — the final word something Jean had insisted on, so confident was she of global success.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was an instinct ratified by history: today, nearly six decades on, Weight Watchers is a vast international empire, spanning everything from magazines and frozen food to cookbooks and cruises, with an annual revenue in 2018 of £1.2 billion.</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/30/21/29017188-0-image-m-18_1590868870615.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>How Phil Vickery's diabetes recipes could save your life:...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/16/06/28458274-0-image-a-53_1589606894719.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>How a health junkie risked everything by quitting her job to...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Latterly rebranded as WW, in the UK its programme is NHS-approved and, since the first meeting here just outside Windsor in 1967, there have been thousands of weekly meetings nationwide, with the brand given the royal seal of approval in 1997 when Sarah Ferguson — then labouring under the unflattering soubriquet ‘The Duchess of Pork’ — was appointed its spokeswoman.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now the story of what many see as the founding business of the slimming industry is told in a book called This Is Big, by Marisa Meltzer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Part diet memoir, part social history, it is the first outsider’s chronicle of how one woman would make calorie counting and weekly weigh-ins part of everyday life for millions all over the world.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Or, how, as Jean was fond of saying: ‘I took the “L” out of flab.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Until the horrifying moment when she was mistaken for a mother-to-be, she had never thought of herself as fat.

Naturally attention-loving, she started inviting girlfriends to her apartment every Thursday.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They called it Jean’s Group and it grew quickly, going from six women to ten to 40 within two months. ‘People would call and ask: “Can I bring my cousin?” “Can I bring my sister?” The answer was always: “Sure, why not?”’ Jean recalled. When chairs ran out people brought their own.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Soon the group outgrew her living room and spilled into her foyer, and from there into her apartment complex’s basement</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In those early days though, Jean had little idea this would be the beginning of a multi-million-dollar business: at first, she was just delighted to have reached her goal weight, which she did in October 1962, around a year after she’d started at the obesity clinic.</p><img id=i-ae8f87a6aa7f8dcf src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/11/21/29504780-8412249-image-a-86_1591909091266.jpg height=475 width=306 alt="The front cover of the new book This Is Big: How the Founder of Weight Watchers Changed the World - and Me" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The front cover of the new book This Is Big: How the Founder of Weight Watchers Changed the World - and Me</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now the equivalent of a UK size 10, she celebrated with a makeover, buying a Jackie Kennedy-inspired wardrobe of shift dresses and chic monochrome suits. She never put on the weight again.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When she wasn’t holding meetings meanwhile, she was driving to attend gatherings of dieters who lived outside New York, among them one at the home of her friends Felice and Al Lippert.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A marketeer, Al saw the potential in Jean’s programme and suggested turning her weight-loss salons into a proper business by franchising the idea and charging people a weekly fee to attend. He suggested Jean meet his lawyer brother Harry to make it official — the first step being to come up with a name.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jean suggested ‘Lose Pounds’ and ‘Watch Your Weight’ — both vetoed by Harry as awful. ‘All right, what about Weight Watchers International?’ said Jean — already thinking big despite the fact her business didn’t have official premises.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry told her that was ridiculous too — but drew up the papers and in May 1963 Weight Watchers International was incorporated.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Its revenue model was simple: franchise holders — all of whom were Weight Watchers graduates and many of whom were women with an investment in the company that was not just financial but emotional — paid around $2,000 and were contractually obligated to pay Weight Watchers 10 per cent of their gross revenue.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For her first official meeting Jean rented a £59-a-month loft space above a local cinema. She charged £1.50 for a meeting — the same as a cinema ticket — and set out 50 chairs. It wasn’t nearly enough: in the event 400 people came, with Jean forced to organise a rota system to see them all.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Weight Watchers International was on its way. By 1969, the company had 102 franchises in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Great Britain and Israel, and about 1.5 million members.</p><img id=i-bf4dd3687bc4fff7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/11/22/29505762-8412249-image-a-89_1591909268987.jpg height=430 width=634 alt="Nidetch with a food scale at her Manhattan office in 1988.&nbsp;By 1966 the company had produced its own Cook Book, followed two years later by the first issue of Weight Watchers magazine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Nidetch with a food scale at her Manhattan office in 1988.&nbsp;By 1966 the company had produced its own Cook Book, followed two years later by the first issue of Weight Watchers magazine</p><img id=i-f92526e167665bad src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/11/22/29506424-8412249-image-m-91_1591910264324.jpg height=390 width=634 alt="Nidetch pictured in the 1960s.&nbsp;By 1969, the company had 102 franchises in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Great Britain and Israel, and about 1.5 million members" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Nidetch pictured in the 1960s.&nbsp;By 1969, the company had 102 franchises in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Great Britain and Israel, and about 1.5 million members</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Its success in the UK — where that first meeting was held in 1967 — was no doubt helped by securing the approval of no less than Jessica Mitford, one of the glamorous, aristocratic Mitford clan, who that year was living in San Francisco when a friend put a ‘before and after’ picture of Jean Nidetch on her fridge to inspire her overweight teen daughters.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mitford was suspicious of the photo and the whole Weight Watchers operation, wondering if, as she put it, it was ‘just another device to separate the fool from his (or more likely her) money’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But after researching a piece about the organisation for the New York Post, she found her cynicism quashed: ‘I came to scoff, but I stayed to applaud.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By 1966 the company had already produced its own Cook Book, followed two years later by the first issue of Weight Watchers magazine. Sales of own brand meals, sweeteners and stock cubes helped its burgeoning growth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Weight Watchers went public, in 1968 reporting a gross revenue of $5.5 million. Jean — now thin and famous — was also rich, wealthy enough to buy her entire apartment block and fund a life of fur coats and first-class flights.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One person, though, was less impressed by this transformation in the marital fortunes, her husband Frank. In 1971, after 24 years of marriage, the Nidetches divorced, with Jean fond of proclaiming Frank ‘liked me better when I was fat’. Weight Watchers continued to flourish: by 1973 it had an annual turnover of around £12 million and celebrated its tenth anniversary with a huge party at New York’s Madison Square Garden.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jean would later call that party one of the highlights of her life, but months later, aged just 49, she stepped down from the company, proclaiming herself tired of the constant travel and demands of promotional appearances.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She remained the public face of the firm, although she played no role when, in 1978, Heinz made a takeover approach to Weight Watchers. After negotiations between Heinz’s president Tony O’Reilly and Al Lippert it was agreed H. J. Heinz Company would acquire Weight Watchers International for about £56 million.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With no seat on the board, Jean retained the perfunctory title of consultant, albeit a wealthy one: she received about £5.5 million in the sale, a huge sum at the time. Not bad for the daughter of a cab driver and a manicurist from Brooklyn, New York. But by 1990 she had apparently swapped one compulsion, eating, for another, gambling.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After moving to Las Vegas she frittered away so much of her fortune that by her 80s she was no longer a millionaire.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile, Weight Watchers scored one of its biggest coups in 1997 when Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, was announced as a spokeswoman for the firm. ‘I am a regular woman with regular problems, hence why I am here today,’ she said. A year later she published her Weight Watchers–approved cookbook, Dining With The Duchess.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was one of many glamorous celebrity associations for the organisation, which today counts Oprah Winfrey and actress Kate Hudson as ambassadors.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Its founder, meanwhile, saw out her years feeling she had become something of a footnote. She died on April 29, 2015, aged 91 — her legacy, for all her latter-day anonymity, an organisation started from her living room which today remains a global behemoth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic><a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>This Is Big: How The Founder Of Weight Watchers Changed The World (And Me)</a> by Marisa Meltzer is out now published by Hachette USA.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKFdX2Ra2tyZ3qarq95raKbnqyTnXqnu9GtrKedXYyyqrPHrY6arJOdsrO%2FjKecsGWSpLysedGerZ6ZnKh6qK3Mm6OenF2ivK%2Bx2GaYsJmpY7W1ucs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
