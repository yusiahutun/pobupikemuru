The bar’s menu consists things like fried pickles, green tomatoes and corn fritters and something frightening called a “flaming pig pick,” and while I am not one to argue that these are indeed Southeastern flavors, my associations have always been in sweeter, homier places: berry pies, cobblers and pretty much anything that has known, been adjacent to or looked at a pecan in it’s life.</p><p><span id=more-201></span></p><p><a href=# title="strawberry rhubarb pecan loaf"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.static.flickr.com/129/415576436_6cab44caf5_z.jpg alt="strawberry rhubarb pecan cake" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Last week, so eager for the spring weather, <a href=#>a getaway</a>, and yes, some South in our mouths, I made a strawberry rhubarb pecan cake, in hopes to get our palates into gear. It was delicious, and demolished by my coworkers in no time, but always the nit-picker, I wasn’t overwhelmed with it. It didn’t rise enough, I wanted more fruit, more grit, and more adherence: slices would crumble into smaller pieces when you picked them up and the sprinkled-on topping fell of as soon as I flipped it out of the pan, much to the disappointment of my husband, who had just swept the kitchen floor. I know I should have let it go—hell, it was plenty tasty—but I couldn’t in good conscience tell you to make something that I knew had structural issues. See how earnest I can be? It’s nauseating, really.</p><p>Of course, my tweaks just had to involve a splash of booze, but you probably knew that was coming. More egg, fruit, baking soda, some whole wheat flour, baking soda and a real crumb topping fix other ills, though it still didn’t stick as much as I’d wanted it to, and could be easily nixed. I like it a lot though, and it’s going right into the repertoire alongside <a href=#>banana bread</a> and <a href=#>lemon loaves</a>. Don’t wouldn’t underestimate the power of a few Southern flavors in a snow-strewn city; just two days later, it’s 50 degrees and sun has been promised for tomorrow. Dare I declare spring on the horizon? I’d never be so presumptuous, but I will have more cake.</p><p><a href=# title="strawberry rhubarb pecan loaf"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm1.static.flickr.com/146/415576442_b8d0c1c29c_z.jpg alt="strawberry rhubarb pecan cake" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Strawberry Rhubarb Pecan Loaf</strong></p><p>Makes one loaf</p><p>3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed<br>1/3 cup vegetable oil<br>1 egg<br>1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br>1 tablespoon rum<br>1 cup flour<br>1/4 cup whole wheat flour<br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br>1 teaspoon baking soda<br>1/4 cup sour cream<br>1/2 cup diced rhubarb<br>1/2 cup sliced strawberries<br>1/4 cup chopped pecans</p><p><u>Topping (Optional)</u><br>1 tablespoons granulated sugar<br>1/4 teaspoon cinnamon<br>3 to 3 1/2 tablespoons flour<br>2 tablespoons butter, melted<br>1/4 cup chopped pecans or walnuts</p><p>Beat together the brown sugar, vegetable oil, egg, vanilla and rum.
