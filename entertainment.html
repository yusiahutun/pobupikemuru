Enter Mama’s Family: The sitcom debuted in 1983 as a spinoff of the earlier show’s popular series of “The Family” sketches, and had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vicki Lawrence</a> reprise her hilarious role as cranky old widow Thelma Harper.</p><p><strong>MUST-READ</strong>: <a href=#>‘The Carol Burnett Show’ Cast Then and Now: A Celebration of Laughter and Talent</a></p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Viewers loved tuning in to the wacky calamities of the Harper clan, extended non-Harper family members and their neighbors, proven by the fact that Mama’s Family ran for six seasons and 130 episodes until 1990.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The enduring appeal of Mama’s Family</h2><p>Entering Mama’s house revealed risky family dynamics from the outset. The series started with Thelma and her spinster sister Fran (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rue McClanahan</a>) opening their home to Thelma’s recently divorced son Vinton (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ken Berry</a>). And his teenage daughter, Sonja (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Karin Argoud</a>). And his son, Buzz (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Brown</a>). From there, all kinds of wacky family antics took place, as we came to love both Mama’s family the people and Mama’s Family the show.</p><p>Reflecting on the enduring appeal of the show, Lawrence said, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I think everybody knows this kind of family</a>. Everybody has got the dysfunctional family, so that’s the wonderful thing about the show.”</p><p>Lawrence’s costars admired her dedication to capturing Thelma in all her grouchy glory. As Berry said in an interview, “Vicki had become one of the best sketch artists on television. She put on those glasses and a wig and a fat suit, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I bought it</a>!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/mamas-family_iDmnXm-edited.jpg><p>Over the course of the series, Mama Thelma Harper remained the center of all the show’s bickering and hilarious misunderstandings. With her gray-wigged, purse-lipped, quick-tempered demeanor, Lawrence brought humor and heart to a complicated role. Yes, there were lots of zingers and sarcasm, but underneath it all she was a nurturing and obliging mother to her family and friends.</p><p>Mama may not have always been the nicest, but at the end of the day, she allowed many different folks to move into her home, where she cooked and cleaned for everyone, sometimes without a thank you or any appreciation. Looking back on her signature character, Lawrence once quipped, “Mama has her own career. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">She’s like her own person</a>. There’s going to be a picture of Mama on my obit.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mama’s Family fun facts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/mamas-family_0nFNld-edited.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1.
