These days, facial cleansing brushes are stepping in to help remove makeup, dead skin, and pollution, thanks to motorized brush heads that get a deeper clean than your hands alone can.

The silicone bristles deep clean your skin, exfoliating away any dirt, and unclogging pores to reveal a clean and refreshed complexion. But the deep clean doesn’t stop there: The high-tech tool also spotlights a unique heating and cooling feature. “The brush works effectively, removing makeup and exfoliating my face without irritating my sensitive skin,” our tester shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With five different modes to choose from (ranging from soft gentle vibrations to more intense settings) you can truly customize the intensity to your skincare needs. Plus, you can also adjust the temperature with the heating and cooling modes. The former helps open up your pores for a deep clean, while the latter tightens and firm your skin. Our tester found that adjusting the temperature settings wasn’t very straightforward, but once she got the hang of it she liked the options. Once you find the perfect speed and temperature, the smart device automatically saves it so everything will already be set the next time you use it. It doesn’t stop there: The unique tool also takes you through your whole skincare routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once ready to apply moisturizer or serum, flip the brush around and the massage setting will help your skincare products soak in. It also aids in wrinkle prevention and stimulates collagen production. The cherry on top: It comes in five different colors, so you can pick one to match your self-care aesthetic. Our tester loves this cleansing brush so much she added it to her Amazon cart right after this test. “It’s very hard for me to find a brush that's effective and doesn't irritate my skin, but the price on this is very affordable and the material seems to last long.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Silicone | <strong>Speed Settings:</strong> Five | <strong>Special Features:</strong> Heating and Cooling, Massage Feature</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-foreo-luna-3></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Foreo Luna 3</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Foreo Luna 3" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/b11dgB2yWF5Llb2r8-r9HIOk4Dc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/foreo-luna-3-237f1c86349e477c99766a4cff2ffc04.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Foreo Luna 3 is a true investment: Its compact size, smart tech features, and effortless ability to provide you with a deep cleanse makes it worth every penny. Not to mention, the cleansing brush has 16 different pulsating intensities (that you can customize to your skin’s needs) to whisk away any makeup or debris. Made of short nonporous silicone bristles (which help prevent the spread of bacteria), this tool easily removes every trace of the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I was surprised at how well the Foreo removed my foundation, eyeshadow, and lipstick — I did have to rinse my face a few times to finish getting the makeup off, but it took just a few splashes of water and a light towel wipe to feel totally clean and makeup-free,” shares our tester. As a bonus, this high tech beauty favorite connects to an app that has a visual guide to show how to properly clean each area of the face. While our tester loves the useful app, she also wishes it was “more intuitive to use, so that you could access the different mode options [on the tool] without the need for your cell phone.” Regardless, she loves the luxuriousness of the brush and thinks it would be a “great gift for the beauty lover who seems to have everything.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Silicone | <strong>Speed Settings:</strong> 16 | <strong>Special Features:</strong> App compatibility</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-olay-regenerist-face-cleansing-device></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Olay Regenerist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Olay Facial Cleansing Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xKzo2VCHYY4ptqgX8ZR4bP5yBLo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Facial-Cleansing-Brush-8d574b43ada84b75ba65783fb44c58c2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For under $30, we’re highly impressed with this drugstore facial cleansing brush. This brush comes with two heads (they’re both the same, FYI—one is meant to be a replacement) and features two speeds. The bristles are sturdy but not abrasive, so we wouldn’t recommend it if you’re looking for a deep exfoliation, especially since the speeds aren’t very fast. You will eventually need to shell out for <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">replacement heads</a>, sold in packs of two. But for an affordable price (and considering it’s frequently on sale), we think this device is definitely worth a try.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Soft bristles | <strong>Settings:</strong> 2 | <strong>Special Features:</strong> Dermatologist-designed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-ezbasics-facial-cleansing-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>EZBasics Facial Cleansing Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="EZBasics Facial Cleansing Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0Cs71dWqkoPc8vSMiCLl_wmmfrI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ezbasics-facial-cleansing-brush-d970cf1b6a27469f8b0e8032f044b541.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You don’t have to spend a ton of money to get a quality facial cleansing brush. Case in point: This one from EZBasics Brush is under $40 and stands out for its deep cleaning abilities, hygienic material, and cute, compact size. Made of silicone bristles, this battery-powered tool removes stubborn makeup and dirt with the choice of five different speeds, so you can adjust it to fit your skin type.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It felt like it was able to get a good amount of makeup off while also removing dead skin,” our tester shares. “I think it's a great alternative to facial scrubs or harsher tools that might be irritating.” It’s important to note that while she doesn’t think the bristles are necessarily abrasive, she says they are “a little rougher than the average cleansing brush.” Overall, with such a great price tag and its ability to fit it in the palm of your hand, the device is great for travel and gives you more control when cleansing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Silicone | <strong>Speed Settings:</strong> 5 | <strong>Special Features:</strong> Wireless charging</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-silicone-vivalui-wireless-ultrasonic-silicone-electric-facial-cleansing-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Silicone</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vivalui Wireless Ultrasonic Silicone Electric Facial Cleansing Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vivalui Wireless Ultrasonic Silicone Electric Facial Cleansing Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FCE-XYeRlti1B24vkv_cj43kMhk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vivalui-wireless-ultrasonic-silicone-electric-facial-cleansing-brush-410dea370c3249b18cdd51294c6e52ca.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vivalui</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Silicone cleansing brushes are often more gentle and hygienic than those with nylon bristles, making them great for all skin types — and this one from Vivalui is one of the best. Made of a luxurious silicone material that gently cleanses the skin, this tool dissolves makeup and clears clogged pores. Compact and lightweight, this brush features two modes (lower and stronger vibration options), and even includes a heating setting to open up your pores. While our tester notes she felt little difference between the two settings, she says that her skin “felt noticeably more cleansed than when I use my hands.” The brush effortlessly unclogs pores by shaking sebum loose, leaving you feeling refreshed and oil-free. As a bonus, the brush is even easy to clean: “I noticed all the suds and residue sliding off the brush when placed in water,” our tester says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Silicone | <strong>Settings:</strong> 2 | <strong>Special Features: </strong>Heating</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-easiest-to-use-buttah-skin-buttah-vibe-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Easiest to Use</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Buttah Skin Buttah Vibe Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Buttah Skin Buttah Vibe Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8zXT1SbfnLU9bIkBtfEe2__YvPA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/buttah-c836e36f282944399eb93e5870b565bf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Macy's</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">New to cleansing brushes? The Buttah Vibe Brush is a great place to start. This no-fuss brush is straightforward with two settings to seamlessly remove any makeup. According to our tester, the sonic pulsations leave skin looking and feeling better than before. “It made my skin feel very soft, silky, and smooth and left me glowing,” she shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While many brushes are too harsh to use daily, this one is gentle enough for everyday use yet still manages to invigorate the skin. “I feel so energized after washing my face with the brush — it feels like a good face massage,” our tester adds. She also shares that the brush did require a few rinses before it was fully clean, but the simplicity of the product and chic design make it totally worth it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Silicone | <strong>Settings:</strong> 2 | <strong>Special Features:</strong> 10,000 pulsations per minute</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-ergonomic-roseskinco-petal-2-ultrasonic-facial-cleansing-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Ergonomic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RoseSkinCo.

The handle is designed to fit perfectly into the palm of your hand, giving you more control, and the shape of the head allows the bristles to effortlessly cup your face, allowing it to more easily cleanse, massage, and rejuvenate your complexion. “The small, light, aerodynamic shape of the handle makes this brush very easy and comfortable to use,” our tester shares. Featuring circulating beads that pulsate over 10,000 times per minute, this brush will transform your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester raves about its offerings, saying “the surprise winning feature is the massage setting, which is total bliss and a bonus.” Another surprising yet welcome feature: The hygienic stand. “I like that it has a little stand so you can let it air dry by the sink, rather than placing a damp brush back in a plastic case,” she shares. Although we wish it also came with a case for travel, you can simply just throw it in your makeup bag for safekeeping on-the-go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Silicone | <strong>Settings: </strong>4 | <strong>Special Features:</strong> 10,000 pulses per minute</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-manual-alder-new-york-cleansing-facial-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Manual</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Alder New York Cleansing Facial Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Alder New York Cleansing Facial Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WJcPBmmhiwk6GtIjq3tymQiqStU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Alder-New-York-Cleansing-Facial-Brush-8da9cb0e669e4420af582ea0ed7db847.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Alder New York</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If electronic face brushes are too high-tech for you, go back to the basics with the Alder New York Cleansing Facial Brush. This artfully crafted brush features a sleek design and high-quality bristles, and offers an amazing cleanse that gently removes makeup or any other residue. The ergonomic palm handle gives you the utmost control; plus, the brush is made of nylon material, a vegan alternative to animal hair bristles (an eco-conscious effort made by the brand). “The vegan vinyl is a very unique feeling on my skin, almost like a soft brush for a horse's mane (ironic, I know),” our tester shares. “The bristles are firm but form to my face as I move the brush, and don’t cause any irritation,” she adds. She does highlight that due to the long and firm bristles, the brush is a bit difficult to clean. “I feel it would never be fully clean again until I was able to use some liquid solution to get deep into the bristles.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon | <strong>Settings:</strong> 1 | <strong>Special Features:</strong> N/A</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-versatile-braun-face-epilator-facespa-pro-911></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Versatile</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Braun Face Epilator Facespa Pro 911</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Braun Face Epilator Facespa Pro 911" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/x369lW1FlluETXPKwVgaGNins2g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/braun-face-epilator-facespa-pro-911-facial-hair-removal-for-women-hair-removal-device-3-in-1-epilating-cleansing-brush-and-skin-toning-with-3-extras--ce67a65b4aac4028820f576de24d641c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a facial cleansing brush that does more than just scrub, we recommend the Braun FaceSpa Pro. This handheld device comes with three attachments: a facial cleansing brush that oscillates, a toning head for facial massage, and an epilator head for removing facial hair. The cleansing brush bristles are stiff yet soft and don’t seem to irritate sensitive skin. Although this brush head doesn’t rotate, the oscillations get the job done, and we love the built-in timer that goes off every 20 seconds, reminding you to switch areas. The brush is a tad smaller than the others we tested, but we wouldn’t call that a dealbreaker. The toning device is a major bonus if you’re a skincare devotee since it encourages better product absorption (just dab the product on top of the toning head and turn it on to apply it to your face).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Soft bristles | <strong>Settings:</strong> 4 | <strong>Special Features: </strong>Attachments for epilating and toning</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We started by researching the best facial cleansing brushes on the market. After conducting some online investigation, we came up with a list of 19 top-rated cleansing brushes. Then, our testers washed their faces using each tool and all of its respective features. Next, our testers cleaned the brush, examining how easy it was to remove any lingering product. They then rated the brushes on a scale of 1 to 5 in four important categories: Ease of use, effectiveness, comfort, and ease of cleaning. Once all the testers provided their ratings and feedback, we narrowed down the list to the seven best facial cleansing brushes.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to facial cleansing brush material they are mostly made of silicone or synthetic bristles. Beauty editor and esthetician, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Grace Day</a>, advises going for a silicone brush, like the &nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Foreo Luna 3</a> (her personal favorite) or the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Vivalui Wireless Ultrasonic Silicone Electric Facial Cleansing Brush</a>, as this material is less aggressive on sensitive skin and easier to clean. But, if you prefer a bristle brush, we recommend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Alder New York Cleansing Facial Brush</a> because its vegan bristles gently cleanse your skin without irritation.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When purchasing a facial cleansing brush it’s important to understand your size needs. To have more control over your device you want to opt for something smaller, Day advises. “Size-wise, I would make sure it’s not too big — you want to be able to get into all the nooks and crannies of your face to target congested areas [like along your nose] and give your skin a really deep clean,” she shares. The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">NagraCoola Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush</a> allows you to get in all the nooks while still cleansing larger areas like your cheeks and forehead. Additionally, if you are traveling, you want to find a brush that doesn’t take up too much space, and comes in a safe carrying case.

Then wet your device and use circular motions to wash your face. “When using a facial cleansing brush, avoid pressing too hard - instead, skim the brush lightly over your skin,” Day shares. “Focus it on areas where your congestion or pores are more noticeable, such as around your nose and along your jawline, and avoid using it near your eyes. I also really like to use mine on my lips when they’re particularly dry and chapped.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also, Day notes that these tools work best with water-based gel cleansers rather than foaming or cream face washes. “I find the texture helps them to move easily and the vibrations will also lather up the cleanser,” she shares.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can I use a facial cleansing brush every day?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like lots of beauty products and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>facial tools</a>, truth be told, it depends on your skin type and your skin’s sensitivity levels.

I would always take a read on your skin’s sensitivity before using any exfoliating product, including a facial cleansing brush,” she advises. “Personally, even though my skin isn’t particularly sensitive, I only use my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Foreo</a> one to two times a week, and I don’t use any other physical exfoliants or scrubs.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the best type of facial cleansing brush?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s no one size fits all when it comes to the best cleansing brushes — the best type will differ based on your skin’s needs.
