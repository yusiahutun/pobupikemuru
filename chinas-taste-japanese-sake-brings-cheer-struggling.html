Under the agreement, cargo ships that transport furniture to Japan from China can then be loaded with sake for the return journey.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Goro Yamazaki, director of Kobayashi Shuzo Co, said sake was “becoming more famous in China and we think this is an opportunity for us”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Japanese food became fashionable in China a few years ago, especially with richer people in the big cities, so those same people realised that sake goes well with Japanese cuisine,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brewery, founded in 1878 and based in the town of Kuriyama, is one of the firms linked to the Nitori initiative. Yamazaki hopes its award-winning Kitanonishiki brand will catch on in the new market.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We started off slowly, but we exported around 10 kilolitres of sake to China and Hong Kong last year, and we expect to send the same amount again this year,” he said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/04/23/0f63e2e0-d5b8-4e9a-ab06-95db06ee06dc_3ef804e9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kobayashi Shuzo sake is also shipped to Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia, with sales in Southeast Asia particularly strong due to the popularity of snowy Hokkaido as a travel destination – before the coronavirus pandemic – for people from warmer countries.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hiromi Iuchi, of the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers’ Association, said Japan’s national drink had risen in popularity overseas as more foreigners arrived as tourists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Over the last 45 years, domestic consumption of sake has fallen by about one-third, making it very difficult for makers to survive if they rely solely on the domestic market,” she said.&nbsp;</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Sushi is not from Japan: how raw fish and rice became a world favourite</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The United States began importing on a significant scale in the 1990s, but it was not until early in the following decade and the introduction of chilled transportation to preserve the top-quality sakes that it really caught the imagination of American consumers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Around the same time, traditional Japanese cuisine was catching on in a big way, with “washoku” eventually recognised as a Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2013, Iuchi said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Industry statistics indicate that demand for Japanese cuisine – and sake – began to boom in China around 2015, coinciding with the sharp increase in tourist arrivals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When people come to Japan, one of the things they always want to try is the local cuisine, which also means they want to experience sake, making it suddenly popular,” Iuchi said. “Chinese people are very quick to pick up on new trends, so that helped to increase demand after they had gone home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/04/23/44c93de2-361a-432c-b634-98d805b6145f_afedd255.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Figures from the Ministry of Finance suggest consumers in key export markets are becoming more sophisticated in their tastes. Exports fell 12.7 per cent in 2020 from the year before, but the value of those exports was up by more than 3 per cent, indicating that people are going for quality over quantity.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The ministry’s data also shows that Hong Kong and China are driving demand. While the value of exports to the US – which has long dominated the market – fell by 25 per&nbsp;cent last year to 5.1&nbsp;billion yen (US$47.2 million), exports to Hong Kong soared 56.7 per cent to be worth 6.2 billion yen (US$57.4 million) and were up nearly 16 per cent for the Chinese market, totalling 5.8 billion yen (US$53.7 million).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Japanese government is actively supporting exports of sake, said Iuchi, and is encouraging tasting events and online shopping.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are also hopes that a range of free-trade pacts, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, will lead to the easing or even abolition of tariffs on sake imports in many countries.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLmqssSsq7KklWKwtrjTrqmeZ5Gnwaqvy55mbGljZYR3hI6cn6Kmkah6ta3SrZxmopGlrq%2Bx0p5krJmbmnqjvsinnqxlk52ypr6MrKurrZecuaq6xg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
