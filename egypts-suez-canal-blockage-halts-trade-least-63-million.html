Giant cargo ship causes marine traffic jam by blocking Egypt’s Suez Canal
Using the Brent crude oil price of about US$64 a barrel as a value proxy – oil prices shot up after the grounding – the seven vessels carry about US$403 million of crude oil."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If the Ever Given remains stuck into the weekend, three more vessels carrying 2.5 million barrels of oil, worth about another US$160 million, will join the queue from the south, Kpler said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another 15 vessels carrying refined bulk products such as naphtha, jet fuel and petrol have been delayed in crossing the canal due to the congestion, Kpler added. Ten are waiting to the south of the canal, while five others heading south to Asia are stuck in the north.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Five LNG vessels and two liquefied petroleum gas carriers are also either delayed in the canal or are waiting to enter, Kpler said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While attempts to clear the ship from the canal continue, this queue will continue to build.

An average of 50 vessels travel through it each day, carrying about 3 million tonnes of cargo, mainly bulk goods such as LNG, oil, and containers. Each year, nearly 20,000 vessels travel the 200-kilometre artificial waterway, accounting for about 12 per cent of&nbsp;world trade by volume.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ships laden with grains, fertilizers, chemicals, coal, machinery, metal ores and food products all pass through the sea route.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">The grounded ship, due to its massive size, is creating some distortion in the flows of crude and products that are transported through the canalBjornar Tonhaugen</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aside from container traffic, the Suez Canal is important for oil and LNG – meaning prices for the commodities could rise as a result of the blockage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Oil prices climbed on Wednesday, but soft demand due to Covid-lockdowns in Europe will put a ceiling on the increase, according to energy consultancy, Rystad Energy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Just when bullish traders thought that the price party was over, they got an unexpected gift, as the Suez Canal blockage is temporarily disrupting usual tanker traffic and the respective expected oil and LNG deliveries,”said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The grounded ship, due to its massive size, is creating some distortion in the flows of crude and products that are transported through the canal and such ‘speed-bumps’ are having a rollover effect on oil prices, as the product will not reach its buyers as quickly as expected.”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/12/10/web_plain_cargo_loss_japan.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:44</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Cargo ship loses more than 1,800 containers in Pacific storm</p><p>Cargo ship loses more than 1,800 containers in Pacific storm</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said, however, the effect would likely be small and transient as there were alternative shipping routes for crude and other products.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But if the blockage lasts for more than a few days, it could impact prices,” he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like Rystad, Wood Mackenzie analysts were optimistic given the high amount of oil stocks being transported in the Atlantic basin.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The impact on LNG supply and prices would also be limited as long as the congestion was resolved within days, Wood Mackenzie principal analyst Lucas Schmitt said.
