 Years after their divorce, Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner remained deeply in love. I saw for myself how abiding their mutual affection was when, one evening, more than a decade after they had separated, I joined them for supper."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I saw for myself how abiding their mutual affection was when, one evening, more than a decade after they had separated, I joined them for supper.</span><br></p><p><span>Frank and Ava, the great crooner and the Hollywood star, were dining quietly in an unassuming New York restaurant and my first husband, jazz pianist Robin Douglas-Home, and I had been invited, too.</span><br></p><p><span>Frank and Robin had forged a friendship over a biography he had been writing of Sinatra. I was modelling for the Eileen Ford agency in New York at the time. It was 1962, a full five years after Frank and Ava had divorced when the four of us enjoyed that modest meal together. Yet what endures in my memory is the palpable chemistry that still existed between the singer and the actress.</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/07/article-2170026-0135848300001005-789_634x670.jpg height=670 width=634 alt="Hard to let go: Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra - despite their divorce, they still displayed signs of love and affection" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Hard to let go: Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra - despite their divorce, they still displayed signs of love and affection</p><p><span>Although he was married four times, Frank’s one great love remained Ava, and vice versa.

During that uncomfortable evening, all my latent anxieties were awakened. It happened when I complimented the hostess on her delicious savoury souffle starter.</span><br></p><p><span>‘I’d love to have the recipe,’ I said, and wreathed in smiles she said she’d be delighted to share it with me. The prawn and cheese dish, she informed me, had long been one of my husband’s favourites.</span><br></p><p><span>In fact, she went on, Nigel’s ex-wife, an accomplished cook, had perfected the recipe and given it to her. Four-and-a-half decades on I can still summon up the mortification I felt.</span><br></p><p><span>It is odd how such embarrassments have the capacity to rankle and live on, but to understand quite how insecure it made me feel perhaps you, too, have to be a second wife.</span><br></p><span>As the sole member of the company who was excluded from his past life with his sophisticated former wife, I believed I couldn’t contribute a thing</span>&nbsp;<p><span>Nigel was as confident and gregarious as I was shy and self-effacing. His ex-wife was American, and although I hadn’t met her at the time — and indeed had played no part in the break-down of their marriage — I’d formed a graphic mental image of her.</span><br></p><p><span>To me she was soignee, self-assured, glamorous, organised and consummately able in ways I could only dream of being. To her list of aptitudes I could now add another: she was also a very good cook.</span><br></p><p><span>I felt demeaned. I, too, liked to cook, but in that instant I believed I could never match up to my predecessor. I also felt like a wet-behind-the-ears young intruder into Nigel’s older circle of established friends.</span><br></p><p><span>As the sole member of the company who was excluded from his past life with his sophisticated former wife, I believed I couldn’t contribute a thing.</span><br></p><p><span>Although I worked full-time as a model during my early, comparatively brief marriages — I was even on the cover of American Vogue for two months in succession, which apparently qualifies me as a record-holder — I was dreadfully lacking in self-confidence. I thought everything from the shape of my legs to the size of my boobs was wrong and unappealing.</span><br></p><p><span>Tiny slights remain obdurately in my memory. I recall Nigel remarking that I shouldn’t wear nail varnish because it looked ‘wrong’ on my sort of hands. His former wife, of course, had exactly the right sort of hands to set off a manicure.</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/07/article-2170026-13F506E8000005DC-657_306x543.jpg height=543 width=306 alt="Moving on: Sandra with ex-husband Nigel Grandfield - Sandra felt there were always hints of his past around" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Moving on: Sandra with ex-husband Nigel Grandfield - Sandra felt there were always hints of his past around</p><p><span>I still remember how bruised and inadequate I felt when he told me this: it contributed to my probable misapprehension that Nigel really preferred his first wife to me.</span></p><p><span>Yet men often do harbour deep affection for their former spouses. Indeed, they sometimes return to them. It happens; perhaps more often than we realise.</span><br></p><p><span>Comedian John Bishop and his wife split up and were deep into a bitter divorce when she slipped into the audience at one of his gigs. Just as he made a crack at her expense, he saw her out of the corner of his eye and that was it: he felt the irresistible pull an ex-wife so often exerts.</span><br></p><p><span>They were back together in no time. But what would have happened if he had started a new relationship before the old spark was rekindled? His new partner would doubtless have fallen prey to the dreadful insecurities of Second Wife Syndrome.</span><br></p><p><span>Certainly, it is the burning preoccupation of Kate, the heroine of my latest novel, Ex-wives, that her lover will desert her for his ex.</span><br></p><p><span>A year after the death of her husband, Kate falls for Richard, a divorcee who still feels responsible for his former wife who is bi-polar. Kate’s dread that Richard will leave her is all-consuming. It is fed by<br></span></p><p><span>Richard’s bitter teenage daughter Polly, who assures Kate that a rapprochement between her mother and father is inevitable. Kate is a composite character: I’ve drawn on my own experience and that of countless friends to create her. Certainly she shares the sort of anxieties that used to plague me when I was a second wife.</span><br></p><p><span>This is why I often find myself sympathising — unfashionably, I suppose — with the Kates of this world. So often it is the first wives who evoke the compassion and understanding when their marriages fail. Meanwhile their beleaguered successors are scorned and spurned.</span><br></p><p><span>But why? I understand fully if the second wives were instrumental in the break-up of their husband’s marriages, but if they are blameless, why should they be the butt of vitriol and recrimination?</span><br></p><p><span>Liz Hurley elicited a torrent of abuse recently when she dared to admit that the children of her fiancé, former Australian cricketer Shane Warne, by his first wife Simone Callahan, actually rubbed along pretty well with her; so much so that they called her ‘Mummy Two’.</span><br></p><p><span>Ms Hurley was accused of flagrant insensitivity. But what she was actually doing was assuming her rightful place in the maternal hierarchy, behind the first Mrs Warne (Mummy One).</span><br></p><p><span>I believe you have to button your lip and bear it if your ex-husband finds a glamorous new partner whom your children choose to adore. Of course it’s difficult, but the vital thing is that they have adjusted well, and surely your successor is to be applauded, not blamed, for making them happy.</span><br></p><span>Another friend, whose husband has an extravagant ex-wife and four children, tells me he is emotionally and financially drained by them</span><span>&nbsp;</span><p><span>As well as being a second wife, I have also been an ex-wife. David, my second husband, married again after we split up; indeed he is still with his wife Karin. You would, of course, have to ask her how she regarded me all those years ago.</span><br></p><p><span>Certainly, I do not believe I showed her any animosity. I tried to heed my own advice; I wasn’t moody or petulant.</span><br></p><p><span>I’m glad to say that now, 40 years on, I am also still on cordial terms with both Karin and David. Indeed, once a year or so, Michael and I meet them for supper or a social event; we regard them as good friends.</span><br></p><p><span>Yet many ex-wives and second wives never achieve any measure of social harmony, and often it is the children of the first wife who help to stir up resentment and acrimony.</span><br></p><p><span>Teenage children from the first marriage are often the worst offenders. So many hapless second wives are disparaged and ostracised by them. One friend of mine — a second wife — was so demeaned by her two teenage step-daughters, she felt worthless. She was condemned for failing to look after their father and for being a ‘bad influence’ on him. They flatly refused to see him when she was there.</span><br></p><p><span>Little wonder second wives so often feel second best. Another friend, whose husband has an extravagant ex-wife and four children, tells me he is emotionally and financially drained by them.<br></span></p><p><span>When he returns from weekend visits to them he is so exhausted, he has no energy left for her. Yet second wives — possibly also because they are almost invariably younger by ten years than first wives — elicit unwarranted resentment and envy.</span><br></p><p><span>I was a second wife a very long time ago, but I can empathise with my friends and I wanted to write about the vulnerability they feel. There is, after all, little to commend being relegated to Number Two in the pecking order.</span><br></p><p><span>So shouldn’t we redress the balance? Instead of assuming the first wife is noble, martyred and betrayed, should we not try to see things from the perspective of the poor second wife for a change?</span><br></p><span>■ Ex-wives by Sandra Howard is published by Simon and Schuster on July 19, price £7.99.</span><br style=font-weight:700><span>Interview by Frances Hardy</span><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn6QcGdpamZkkbCx0makmqZdqb%2B2uNhmqq2noGK5sMLIp55mnahixKqyxGaKeoZ0h45ulK6QeIt8XZbArL%2BMqqyeq6SevK951KeqnqykobK0edaopJqmXZ3CtK7Ap5tmnJmrvLOvxJ1loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
