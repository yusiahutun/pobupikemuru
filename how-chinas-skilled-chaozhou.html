In relief carving, the pattern projects from the wood surface against a flat backdrop. Carving in the round produces three-dimensional pieces that can be viewed from all angles. With intaglio carving, the design is cut into the wood surface.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before they start carving, craftsmen have to choose the right knives and the right wood. Camphor, China fir, chinaberry and rosewood are all common carving materials.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The process of carving is a complex one and every detail matters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Woodcarvers first outline an image on a thin piece of paper, then placing it on a block of wood before carefully carving out the patterns and putting colours on them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The patterns carved reflect the local culture of Chaozhou.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“One of the most common themes is sea animals such as crabs, lobsters and fish, which is a reflection of the everyday life of the Chaozhou people, many of whom used to be fishermen,” Lau says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The carvings also indicate the hope for abundant catches.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Also popular are signs of blessings such as phoenixes, as well as scenes from folklore, myths and Chaozhou opera that carry a positive message, such as Guo Ziyi’s Birthday Celebration, a story about prosperity and longevity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Chaozhou people perform opera for the deities they worship,” Lau says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/11/23/74b229fc-eca4-11e8-b0fe-c62dccd2d711_1320x770_174508.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“On some carved pieces of multilayered openwork, you will find the detailed depiction of these stories where different scenes are separated by the carving of footpaths, streams and steps.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For crossbeams, Wu considers a form called “three beams, five melons” the most magnificent type of woodcarving.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This form is characterised by short columns in the shape of melons; they simultaneously decorate the beams and support the ceiling above them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Melons, which grow on long vines, are a symbol of abundant offspring,” Wu says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The blossoming of fruit is also a sign of a big, prospering family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/11/23/70650216-eca4-11e8-b0fe-c62dccd2d711_1320x770_174508.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As well as its application on buildings and beams, Chaozhou woodcarving is often used to decorate tools and objects used in religious rituals.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Chaozhou woodcarving reflects our deep feelings for our deities and ancestors: the more detailed the woodwork, the more we show our respectAnven Wu</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These include offering plates, shrine tables on which incense is burned and where ancestor tablets are placed, and the boxes in which sacred food is placed inside a temple.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You give the most precious food to deities, and the container also needs to be of the highest quality, which is why we decorate it with gold,” Wu says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chaozhou people have a long tradition of deity worship.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They are devoted to building and refurbishing temples and ancestral halls, and it is this dedication that has kept the art of woodcarving alive and flourishing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Everyone wants the deities to protect them and their family, and we all want our temples and ancestor houses to be the most spectacular,” Wu says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s a far cry from Hong Kong, where high labour costs are contributing to the speedy decline of the art of woodcarving.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Chaozhou woodcarving reflects our deep feelings for our deities and ancestors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The more detailed the woodwork, the more we show our respect,” Wu says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The tradition is a source of pride for us and reminds us of where we come from.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/11/23/6f6350d4-eca4-11e8-b0fe-c62dccd2d711_1320x770_174508.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Explore the rich, intricate qualities of Chaozhou woodcarving at “Gilded Glory: Chaozhou Woodcarving”, an exhibition dedicated to the exquisite art and culture of the Chaoshan region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is on show now at the Hong Kong Museum of History, in Chatham Road South, Tsim Sha Tsui East, until February 25.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For details, go to <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">hk.history.museum/en_US/web/mh/exhibition/current.html</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6LAyK%2BcaKSZm7K0wNilnGiZoqnAbq%2FUpauuqpVkwbC8yJyqaKelqXqiusNmmJunpal8or7TopqlnV9nfniAlmptaKCfrHqktMinmKxlo6C2rbjEnWScoJGkx6m71A%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
