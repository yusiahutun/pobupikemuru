The businesswoman had everyone seeing double during her 75th birthday celebration, when all of her friends playfully dressed up like her.</p><p>“My best friends surprised me for my birthday dinner all dressed like me! I’d say 75 is looking good … on all of us!” she captioned an Instagram post on March 12.</p><p>In the pictures, Barbara’s friends all wore blonde wings, rocking her signature pixie hairstyle, along with neon green shirts and khaki pants.</p><p>“That’s hilarious! What great friends!” one person commented under the post, while another penned, “That pic definitely stopped me in my tracks from scrolling.”</p><p>The celebration came just after the TV personality revealed that she spent her 70th birthday throwing herself an early funeral. The confession certainly explained the photos of her in a coffin that she has shared on social media in recent years.</p><p>“A few years back, I overheard that my friends were planning a surprise 70th birthday party and they were going to have it in my own home, to surprise me,” she said in a TikTok video. “Well, I hate surprises, and I made up my mind to surprise them instead.”</p><p>She decided it was the perfect time to organize her own funeral, ultimately sending out a mass invite to a black-tie dance party. Her guests had no idea that it was actually going to be a funeral.</p><p>“I found the perfect coffin and turned my living room into a funeral parlor,” she recalled. “When people walked into my own funeral parlor, I could hear them gasp as they walked into the room. They thought I was really dead! A minute later they realized the hoax and the room was rolling with laughter.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/barbara-corcorans-friends-dress-like-her-on-her-birthday.jpg><p>Her guests and her family certainly embraced the experience for what it was. Barbara is a mom to kids <a href=#>Tom and Kate “Katie” Higgins</a>, whom she shares with husband <a href=#><strong>Bill Higgins</strong></a>.</p><p>“My friends and my children came to the coffin to pay their last respects, and I got to hear all the nice things people say about you when you’re dead,” the New Jersey native shared.</p><p>But after a while, the funeral did end up turning into a dance party after all. “Then I did a high kick out of that coffin to start that dancing!” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bmKuakaeubq%2FOq5qoqpGjwG6y0aKcp5yjYrGzsdKsZKWhm5p6qbHRZqanZZiav26DlK2fZpqZp8GpsMCyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
