In a new video, she revealed that she has been dealing with some health problems that prevent her from working.</p><p id=par-3_59>“I go in and out of nauseousness, I go in and out of anxiety,” she explained in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a>. “I feel like I have heart palpitations, I don’t know what’s going on with me but it’s taking everything in my power just to like edit videos and look at the computer screen and then I have to lay back down.”</p><p id=par-4_32>She went on to detail the doctor’s appointments she attended to get to the bottom of the issue, including a trip to the ophthalmologist to discuss the pain in her eye.</p><p id=par-5_50>“I was being seen here because I have eye pain and was referred by my primary doctor just to get an eye checkup and this particular doctor is a nerve doctor, so it’s a neuro-ophthalmologist and a neuro-ophthalmologist looks at the nerves within your eye,” she said into the camera.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_36>“She’s trying to see if my cyst in my head is causing my eye pain and my headaches and she said that based on what she saw that she wants to get an orbital MRI done.”</p><h2 id=h-what-is-wrong-with-jenelle-evans>What is wrong with Jenelle Evans?</h2><p id=par-7_13>Unfortunately, after having her eyes dilated for the tests, Evans’ headache got worse.</p><p id=par-8_24>“I have the worst headache, I have that eyeball pain that I’ve been having so it’s really hard for me to edit any videos.”</p><p id=par-9_19>She also revealed that she’s been having trouble breathing lately but attributed that to the cyst in her spine.</p><p id=par-10_25>“She said the outside of my eye looks great,” Evans said of the doctor. “She didn’t really tell me about the inside of my eye.”</p><p id=par-11_17>Evans’ next MRI isn’t until August so she might not be getting any answers for a while.</p><h2 id=h-fan-reactions-to-jenelle-s-problems>Fan reactions to Jenelle’s problems</h2><p id=par-12_18>Fans were quick to comment on Evans’ video with suggestions as to what could be causing her pain.</p><p id=par-13_27>“Optic neuritis always hurts one eye,” one person wrote. “Are you sure they are cysts and not ms lesions? Have you asked them about ms? (Multiple sclerosis).”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-14_29>“I have no clue,” Evans responded. “I am getting that orbit MRI next month but I def have a cyst in there. It’s HUGE. Maybe I’ll show you guys.”</p><p id=par-15_15>Other fans were more concerned with how Evans was paying for all of her tests.</p><p id=par-16_35>“How is she able to afford all these medical tests and procedures without health insurance from actual employment 😂😂🙄🙄🙄🙄 even if she buys it on the marketplace or still doesn’t cover everything,” one person wrote.</p><p id=par-17_19>“Dude, I need your health care plan,” another person said. “How can you afford all of these inconclusive tests?”</p><p id=par-18_9>Evans has yet to respond to any more fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBprHNZqSopV1nequxzZ6jpZ1dmsOiutJmqZ6ulZa5tHnWqKmkoZ6ce6nAzKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
