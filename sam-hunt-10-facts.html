He's married, from Georgia, played a little football in college and enjoys blending R&B and country music like you may like mixing Jack and Coke. The now-36-year-old Hunt (birthday, Dec 8, 1984) emerged as a hot songwriter in 2012 and wrote hits for Kenny Chesney, Keith Urban and more before gaining attention for songs (some of them the same songs) on the Between the Pines album, an acoustic album he gave away for free on his website."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Everything was working for him, but even as his own headlining tour neared, he wasn't happy personally. Longtime off-and-on girlfriend Hannah Lee Fowler eluded him after he behaved like a bad boyfriend, but that's giving too much away.</p><p>In 2017 he married and went dark for a bit, with only&nbsp;"Body Like a Back Road" to satiate his fans. It'd be six long years between studio albums, but finally — in the spring of 2020 —&nbsp;Southside dropped, featuring hit songs in&nbsp;"Kinfolks" and "Hard to&nbsp;Forget." A huge tour was to start&nbsp;in spring, too, but the coronavirus pandemic wiped all of that out, so here we sit, begging for more from this country music enigma.</p><p>Maybe you know his songs. Maybe you know his love story. But what&nbsp;don't you know about Sam Hunt?
