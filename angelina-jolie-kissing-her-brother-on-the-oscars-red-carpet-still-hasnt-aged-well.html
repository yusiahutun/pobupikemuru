Comedian Ricky Gervais not connecting with his audience with his awkward jokes, and there was even a streaker who stormed on the stage one year. Despite all of that, Angelina Jolie kissing her brother on the <a href=#>Oscars</a> Red Carpet has been burned into fans’ minds. No matter what they do, it’s not moving.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-angelina-jolie-made-history-by-kissing-her-brother-on-the-oscars-red-carpet>Angelina Jolie made history by kissing her brother on the Oscars Red Carpet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-611398266-704x1024.jpg><p>It’s an ick for sure.</p><p><a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> and her brother, James Haven, made a strange and bold declaration of love at the Oscars when they began kissing. The 24-year-old <a href=#>celebrity</a> at the time even spoke about him when she went up on stage to collect her <a href=#>Academy Award statue</a>.</p><p>Cast your minds back to 2000, 24 years ago. It’s an entire generation ago but it’s not so many decades that we can put ‘history’ as the reason for the strange moment.</p><p>Jolie, who has now split from <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>, picked up a golden statue for her role in Girl Interrupted. A lot of <a href=#>movie</a> fans were over the moon for her win, believing the accolade was well-deserved.</p><p>When she arrived on stage to pick up the gong for Best Supporting Actress, she spoke about her brother.</p><p>The Mr and Mrs Smith actor said of her then-26 year old brother: “I’m in shock, and I’m so in love with my brother right now.</p><p>“He just held me and said he loved me, and I know he’s so happy for me. And, um, thank you for that”.</p><p>Then, when she went backstage, they showed how close they were in front of cameras.</p><p>While posing with her statue, Angelina Jolie turned and started kissing her brother on the lips.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-was-just-brotherly-love>‘It was just brotherly love’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1350676685-756x1024.jpg><p>It made headlines around the world, as some are divided on whether you should kiss family members on the lips. It’s a constant debate with no real right answer rooted in science, it just depends on your upbrining.</p><p>When asked about kissing her brother months later, Angelina Jolie insisted it was just ‘brotherly love’</p><p>She told Entertainment Weekly: “My parents really loved that moment, and that’s what will always matter.”</p><p>Her brother James was also questioned by the moment, and he spoke out in 2007.</p><p>He said: “I did not give Angie a French kiss. It was something simple and lovely.</p><p>“She was about to go off to Mexico to finish filming Original Sin with Antonio Banderas.</p><p>“I congratulated her on the Oscar win and gave her a quick kiss on the lips. It was snapped and became a big thing”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-re-still-really-close>They’re still really close</h2><p>Whether or not you agree with Angelina Jolie kissing her brother on the lips, they’ve remained close over the years.</p><p>Reports say James is helping with the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star’s children while she continues working through her divorce with Brad.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> separated in 2016 and in 2021 she said the breakup was for the “wellbeing for her family”, saying it was the “right decision”.</p><p>Neither have spoken much more about the split, but they <a href=#>recently sold their New Orleans mansion</a> so are likely dealing with their shared assets after their 12-year relationship.</p><p>But Jolie isn’t afraid of bold gestures when it comes to love. The actress was previously married to Billy Bob Thornton and they would wear vials of each other’s blood around their necks.</p><p>Thornton didn’t think it was odd and later said Jolie believed it would be “interesting and romantic” if they did it. They made a small cut on their fingers, smeared blood on a locket and wore it around their necks, like a parent who may carry a lock of their child’s hair.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WDcK3NoJyloZ6Wequ7y6KcZqOZqMCqusZmn56qXZe%2FsMDHnqlmp55iwamxjKiqnJmiqHqzscNmmpqqoJrBbr%2FToqOlZZiWwK%2FAjJqenpxdrLKtuI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
