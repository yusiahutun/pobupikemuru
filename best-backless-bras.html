Emily Blunt did it. And they both did it while walking the red carpet — we're talking about going backless. While it's tempting to think that going backless is only something A-listers (or those unafraid of going braless) can get away with, we've got some good news: anyone can pull it off with the help of the right undergarments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jessica Pfister, Vice President of Le Mystere, tells InStyle that as fashion has evolved, the lingerie market has kept pace. "As dresses and tops have taken the plunge from the front and the back, invisible support products have become abundant and super easy to find at retailers like Target, Amazon, and your local department store," she says. Not only did the market keep up, but it did so while keeping comfort at the forefront. "Technological advancements have allowed manufacturers to create more flexible, comfortable options that are less cumbersome than they were in the past," Pfister adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Loosely translated, that means you should have no trouble finding a backless bra to wear with your favorite outfit—and our front-runner for every occasion is the NuBra Seamless Bra Cups for their strong adhesive and invisibility.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-nubra-seamless-adhesive-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NuBra Seamless Adhesive Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NuBra Seamless Adhesive Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qPOe9DmMxS8M638A3m3-vJbgBv0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NuBra-Seamless-Adhesive-Bra-535cae03d2e349199fd29e062827029c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made with medical-grade adhesive and lightweight silicone, the NuBra will be one of the most comfortable backless bras — it won't feel heavy or pull on your skin when you go to take it off. It even has a fabric lining for extra comfort. It comes in cup sizes A-E as well as multiple skin tones, making it particularly versatile. And professional wardrobe stylist and owner of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Builtgracefully</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Grace Thomas</a> thinks every woman should have this bra in their wardrobe. "The NuBra is a best seller for a reason," says Thomas. "With the adhesive backing on the cups, the bra stays in place all day, doesn't slip, and leaves you with a clean strapless, backless look," says Thomas. Plus, with proper care, it can be worn up to 100 times.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you like a little more cleavage NuBra can also help perk up the girls, courtesy of the hook front closure. To help you out, the brand provides directions on the packaging on how to achieve optimal cleavage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>A - E<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>7 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Silicone, polyester, polyurethane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-niidor-adhesive-strapless-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Niidor Adhesive Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Niidor Adhesive Strapless Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZTT37EimfWV8p1dMt1EnWie24ag=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/niidor-adhesive-strapless-bra-e0ebfcb3adfc4f8ba8b5edb252c08943.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The discreet design of this backless design features a flattering deep V-shape in the front, so it works just as well with plunging necklines<strong>,</strong> along with a strong clip to clasp the cups together for cleavage or not.<strong> </strong>Moreover, the adhesive is strong enough to hold for hours<strong> </strong>without slipping — though it does tend to irritate the skin a little bit, especially as you go to take it off since it is super strong — and it beautifully supports larger cup sizes (just be sure to size up or two for more coverage). Plus, it's available in a range of colors and sizes, too<strong>, </strong>all the way up to a G cup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>A - G<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>4 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Silicone</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-gatherall-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gatherall Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gatherall Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fqi4SX-ZrUvtUB_k43rCuJA2F_Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Gatherall-Bra-4237fe2317394234b268fb8ebd5fc9f7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.

But when you spend a solid chunk of change on the product, it would definitely be nice to see it have a bit more longevity. That’s why we love this bra from Gatherall, which can actually be washed. It won’t lose its flexibility after it’s cleaned either, as long as you follow the instructions. You wash it as you would with your strappy bras, hand washing in the sink, using a gentle soap (the brand suggests their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">antibacterial soap</a> with the product) as you hand wash, then leave the bra to hang dry.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The brand makes the sizing super clear, too, offering cup sizes up to a DD and providing charts to allow you to determine which would be the best fit for you. However, they only recommend the bra up to a band size 40. Plus-size bands are typically 42 and above, so plus-size women might not be able to fit in this option. We hope they expand the sizing soon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> A – DD | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Silicone</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-brassybra-adhesive-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Brassybra 3 Sets Adhesive Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/efeGteOcumOZKKkpemHwGCCddtg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Brassybra-3-Sets-Adhesive-Bra-32f0b088e2c14a4b8d5267e83531de6d.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The idea for Brassybra came to founder Katherina Borve after she resorted to using duct tape on her wedding day when she couldn't find a backless bra that fit her breasts. Susan Moses, celebrity stylist and author of The Art of Dressing Curves, is all too familiar with that challenge, which is why she recommends this backless bra to her clients; it <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gives larger breasts support</a>, security, and a discreet lift. It supports cup sizes D and larger as well as comes in different shades to accommodate a wide range of skin tones. Because it technically is just boob tape, it feels weightless and will be comfortable for all-day wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>A - G<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>5 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Cotton, polyurethane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-plunge-necklines-fashion-forms-u-plunge-backless-strapless-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Plunge Necklines</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fashion Forms Strapless Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fashion Forms U Plunge Backless Strapless Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2oM0WRIlgUPe8N7Uf8XeczOj1ko=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Fashion-Forms-U-Plunge-Backless-Strapless-Bra-3e660119743647608fb90193e33c164d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fashion Forms has a long history in the specialty bra market, so whether you're looking for strapless, backless, or anything that's barely there, chances are you'll find it in their assortment. Case in point: The U-Plunge Backless Strapless Bra, which essentially has you covered for virtually any situation. The low U-neckline will accommodate an array of styles, ranging from a sweetheart to a deep v. Reviews suggest it works for even the lowest of cuts, and still manage to do its job without the show. Side boning and molded cups offer plenty of support and lift, and adhesive wings ensure that everyone stays put. It also accommodates cups up to size D, and is available in black and neutral.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>A - D |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Nylon, spandex, silicone adhesive wings</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-small-breasts-fashion-forms-nubra-ultralite-backless-strapless-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Small Breasts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fashion Forms Strapless Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fashion Forms Nubra Ultralite Backless Strapless Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yG5PyLfr3ia0JRYDFy91auj6H4o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fashion-forms-nubra-ultralite-backless-strapless-bra-0c821c110ce647d2bd8f3306d144ccaa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike many backless bra options, this one from Fashion Forms doesn't have side extensions — any support the bra offers comes courtesy of the cups, which are adhesive, wireless, and molded for shape and coverage. Smaller breasts may not need the extra security that those with larger breasts crave. But don't worry, for those looking for some enhancement, the front closure also offers lift and cleavage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's worth noting that while it comes in cup sizes up to DDs, the bra itself offers little support. Though reviewers say that it's still a great backless bra option. On a final note, the product description indicates that this bra is reusable up to 25 times, but care and storage practices can and will affect its performance and longevity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>A - DD<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>1 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Silicone adhesive, polyester, polyurethane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-large-breasts-va-bien-low-back-strapless-bustier></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Large Breasts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Va Bien Low Back Strapless Bustier</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Va Bien Low Back Strapless Bustier" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1L_oTYzHcAqLeUwAyWwg-DMpj4g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/va-bien-low-back-strapless-bustier-a63f6ddb92d44ae58745180f9a919144.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For large breasts, Moses suggests long-line, backless bras for lift, security, and structure. "All of these design elements are really important because, with the absence of straps, you don't want to worry about your bra sliding down, shifting, and ruining your look,'' she says. This bustier from Va Bien checks all those boxes. While it's not technically backless, the super low V-back is low enough to work with a backless top or dress. To offer tons of support for bigger busts, the cups offer tons of hold but we suggest size down because of the extra room. Plus, it's lightweight enough to work under thinner fabrics like silk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>32C - 38D | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester, nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-push-up-nubra-womens-push-up-plunge-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Push-Up</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NuBra Women's Push Up Plunge Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NuBra Women's Push Up Plunge Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SFAo_YW1hYzhgu9WzUlfObww6jc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nubra-womens-push-up-plunge-bra-798837dbd18a4eddb3762c88b9a9380b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you think of a backless bra, you don’t always associate it with lift — just light coverage. But for a backless bra that not only supports but also pushes the gals up for a more lifted effect, try this one from NuBra, which contains extra padding on the inside. While we wish it came in more skin tone options, it suits a wide variety of necklines — v-neck, scoop-neck, plunging — remaining practically undetectable underneath your clothing. Thanks to the medical-grade adhesive, it will stay put, too. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Madison San Miguel</a>, InStyle Contributing Commerce Writer, owns the bra in a size D and confirms its lifting benefits. “I don’t own any push-up bras because of my chest size, but sometimes I need some lift if I am wearing something strapless and/or backless,” she says. “This supported my chest without me needing to adjust it, and gave them more shape.” San Miguel found it to be a bit difficult to remove, though, so keep that in mind if you’ll have to take it off late at night when you just want to go to sleep. But she finds the appearance it gives her worth the extra time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> A – D | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polyurethane, silicone</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shaping-spanx-suit-your-fancy-plunge-low-back-mid-thigh-bodysuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shaping</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Low-Back Mid-Thigh Bodysuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Suit Your Fancy Plunge Low-Back Mid-Thigh Bodysuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bQcrZu1Z-T4plwp8LIRxGXdhOcM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-womens-suit-your-fancy-plunge-low-back-mid-thigh-bodysuit-a45a40e35c904a2c88482b4126bd783d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this piece is not technically a backless bra per se, it is a one-and-done solution. Not only is it deep cut in the back, and plunging in the front, it also offers major support and light shaping, too. You can remove or use the optional back clasp for an open back, adjust the straps in five ways (traditional, narrow back, racerback, criss-cross, and halter), and wear the suit without a bra (it’s lightly padded!) — it’s that versatile. The pièce de résistance, though, might be the Easy Access Gusset that expertly addresses the most common concern women have with one-piece shapewear — going to the bathroom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>XS-XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Elastane and Nylon</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pasties-b-six-nippies-adhesive-nipple-covers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pasties</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>B-Six NIPPIES Nipple Covers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="B-Six NIPPIES Adhesive Nipple Covers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/URs0oorORQyQDW0LdMFdcyADy28=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NIPPIES-Nipple-Covers-for-Women-cffd96d830e64da696fe8a80ed632f67.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you don’t need a lift or quite as much coverage as a full backless bra offers, opt for a nipple cover, instead. Made entirely out of silicone, these nipple covers conceal both the areola and breast (depending on your cup size) with a seamless finish. They’re designed to fit close to your skin tone, too, so that they’re practically invisible (without the lines) underneath clothing. The brand promises that they’ll stick all day long, even if you sweat, and while you can reuse them, you will probably only get two uses out of them.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> A-C, D+ | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Silicone</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-cleavage-umooie-sticky-bra-invisible-lift-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Cleavage</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Umooie Sticky Bra Invisible Lift Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Umooie Sticky Bra Invisible Lift Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2k9Nhp-rg7qV3yAWCgC49PqMCts=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/umooie-sticky-bra-invisible-lift-bra-986690a66a214e808c925b16b7b15306.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Need more or less cleavage? This sticky bra has you covered with its adjustable drawstring ties that allow you to customize how much it pushes your breasts together — just pull up or down the string to fix the cups to your liking; it doesn’t even require a knot or tie. It gives smaller breasts a perkier, more lifted appearance, similar to the pushup qualities found in the NuBra. But the ties might appear under tighter clothing because they don’t entirely lay flat. This would work best under a looser fitting, backless garment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> A – D | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-converter-lady-up-womens-low-back-bra-converter></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Converter</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lady Up Women’s Low Back Bra Converter</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lady Up Women&amp;rsquo;s Low Back Bra Converter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZvNhP9qhsyNE4d4rCklGumx5OUc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lady-up-womens-low-back-bra-converter-b2ba2f18ec844090bea03a2d02f268b2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For an exceptionally affordable option, turn your favorite bra into a backless one with this converter that attaches to the band of your bra, crosses behind your back, then connects again on your stomach. We know this sounds a bit complicated, but the converter, which gives you 12.6 to 17 extra inches, allows you to lower your band up to five inches to suit a low back top that still has straps. Larger busts might appreciate this option, too, because you can gain the support needed from your bra without having the back show. The nylon and spandex blend boosts its durability, too, so trust that it has enough stretch to accommodate you. We wish it came in more sizes, though, to accommodate plus-size folks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> One size | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cup Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It should come as no surprise that cup size plays an important role in your purchase of a backless bra.

"No matter how amazing you look, if you are taped to the hilt or bandaged up so much that you cannot breathe, you are not going to be able to enjoy your evening," she says. Instead, Pfister suggests opting for a backless bra or adhesive that gives you enough support, but also allows you to move . "If you are a smaller cup size, sometimes just a nipple cover will do the trick," she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Application</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Backless bras are different from your standard bras.

"If you find a low back bra or bustier, it's possible that you get the lift and support you crave," she says. "However, if you are using adhesives, are over a C cup, or have very full or pendulous breasts, you need to level-set your expectations and accept that a natural support level is ok, trending, and looks quite beautiful."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are the adhesives used for backless bras skin safe?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Pfister, the adhesives used in backless bras are typically medical-grade, hypoallergenic, moisture-resistant, and breathable. "This is a major step up from the duct tape that was used by celebrities for years! Talk about sacrificing comfort for fashion," she says. "For the most part, companies rigorously test their product to confirm consumer safety with use. I would say unless your skin is extremely sensitive, these products are fairly safe for most people." She also suggests reading the fine print if you have a latex allergy to ensure the bra you choose is latex-free.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Since many backless bras are adhesive, can I use duct tape or masking tape in a pinch?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The answer to this one is a resounding no. Yes, we've all been in a tight spot and have probably done some questionable things to get through the night and make our look "work," but duct tape or masking tape should never be an option. The adhesives used in those products are super strong and not intended for human skin. Ultimately, they can cause inflammation and allergic reactions, not to mention they can actually peel your skin off.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sharon Brandwein</a> is a freelance writer based in Alabama.
