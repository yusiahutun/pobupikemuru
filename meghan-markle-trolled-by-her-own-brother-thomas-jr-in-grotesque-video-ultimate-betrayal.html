I’m gonna be riding those coat-tails, baby. Oh, yeah, if it wasn’t for Meghan Markle, I don’t know what I’d be doing.”</p><p>There are actually numerous videos of him taking aim at his sister. Across the videos, which he calls “shows”, he not only mocks her for her behavior, appearance, etc. but also brings up her children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-slammed-for-grotesque-trolling-videos>He’s slammed for ‘grotesque’ trolling videos</h2><p>An assortment of people have quickly reacted to the recent “Me-gain” video of Thomas.</p><p>Jennie Bond, a royal commentator, called the monologue “grotesque” and more when <a href=# rel=nofollow>speaking</a> with the Daily Mail. “To have your own flesh and blood lead the assault must feel like the ultimate betrayal for Meghan,” she commented.</p><p>British politician Damian Collins told the publication that the videos from Thomas could constitute harassment. “The major social media companies must do more to combat harmful content on their platforms,” he argued, “including campaigns of harassment and intimidation.”</p><p>One member of the public recently tweeted that they wish to call out bad behavior on both sides: “Thomas Markle Jr’s video is in bad taste. You blew any credibility you could’ve had, TM Jr. This video makes Meghan Markle look aristocratic by comparison.”</p><p>Others have simply dismissed Thomas’ behavior online as childish “trolling”, and reactions continue to pour in.</p><p>The Duchess hasn’t responded to the videos.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aFcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kraqfobmmsIybsGaglad6sMPNZpmrp6SdsrN506GmppmjYrezecinZKCqn6mytL3UnmSvoZSavG7By62gppmkmnqjsdOrmLKZnGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
