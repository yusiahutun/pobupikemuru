The correct cocktail of styling products can bring bounce, definition, and life back to your curls.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the things that makes a curl cream stand out against the rest is that you can’t feel it in your hair once it’s dry. There’s nothing worse than crafting the perfect spirals only to realize that your seemingly impeccable style is either crunchy (thanks, gel), straw-like (many sprays have this effect), or lie limp (no matter how fluffy mousse is, it does not translate to your hair).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Knowing how important curly hair products can be, we tapped experts to bring you the best curl creams for every budget and every curl type.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-ouai-curl-crme></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ouai Curl Crème</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lK3n9AfRYmzJepwyzFv85TvhFq4=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/OuaiCurlCreme-b7312239f05542d4b007b9f9d365e6e3.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This curl crème is killer at combating frizz.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: It doesn’t hold a curl’s shape for very thick hair as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ouai Curl Crème is a master at frizz fighting. With a little dollop on your palms, run this cream through your wet hair and your natural curls will form just as they were intended — but with little to no static to speak of. Once dry, the cream is totally absorbed into your hair, so it leaves no sticky, tacky, or crunchy feel when you run your hands through your hair. That said, this is not the cream for very thick heads of hair. It’s meant to train your curls into their natural shape, and won’t provide support to hold any heavy ringlets in place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ok, now for the icing on the cake: This curl cream truly smells amazing. Though it does come in an unscented version, I highly recommend the North Bondi scent. North Bondi incorporates bergamot and lemon, it gives off a slightly citrus scent while still smelling classic enough to wear every day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>8 fl oz |<strong> Ingredients: </strong>Chia and Linseed Oils, Coconut Oil, Babassu Oil | <strong>Sulfate Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-ogx-moroccan-curling-perfection-defining-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>OGX Moroccan Curling Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="OGX Moroccan Curling Perfection Defining Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HEw6zhDjO4paM5QnU8bd9jhbZ08=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/OGXMoroccanCurlingPerfectionDefiningCream-c9a6e7838184426a972b7ac9ce02e501.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: Creates curls that are not only moisturized but also totally soft as well.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: A little bit goes a long way and it’s not quite as buildable as other products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Isn’t it lovely when you can make a quick stop at a drugstore, or shop a selection on Amazon Prime, and have your best hair attainable in a snap? Well, that’s exactly what OGX curl cream does for you. Much like some of its pricier counterparts, OGX uses Moroccan argan oil to lock in moisture and prevent frizz. With their unique formula, you will have curly hair that is moisturized and bouncy, but also frizz free and soft as ever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6 oz | <strong>Hydrating Ingredients: </strong>Argan Oil | <strong>Sulfate Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fine-hair-adwoa-beauty-baomint-moisturizing-curl-defining-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Fine Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Adwoa Beauty Baomint Moisturizing Curl Defining Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1376 data-sizes=750px alt="Adwoa Beauty Baomint Moisturizing Curl Defining Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wiciZ84-mpSz2y4ykvWkXHIfehQ=/fit-in/1500x1376/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ScreenShot2022-07-19at5.04.19PM-0cd7aac6b4354d7cba717af6eb985ca8.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Adwoa Beauty</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It is infused with proteins to not only moisturize, but also strengthen hair.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: Because it comes in a jar instead of a tube, it’s a bit messier to use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have thinner hair, you know that the must-haves in a curl cream are extensive, and at times, contradictory. Sure, it has to be ultra-moisturizing, but it can’t be too heavy; and, most importantly, many thin hair possessors have just as much issue with their hair retaining moisture as infusing it in the first place. Adwoa has crafted a curl cream that does double duty, not only using ingredients like baobab and cactus oil, but also proteins that will lock the moisture in and help to strengthen your curls for future hair health as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>3.3, 16 oz | <strong>Hydrating Ingredients: </strong>Honey, Silk Amino Acids, Shea Butter | <strong>Sulfate Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thick-hair-amika-curl-corps-defining-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Thick Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amika Defining Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amika Curl Corps Defining Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kL71_IFzIEc0k7uc6iptCO-pA38=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amika-curl-corps-defining-cream-c5b49b1de6cf47ce938ab6ed74b4a202.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It’s strong enough to use on even the thickest of hair.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: Be careful not to use too much: it can get greasy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Amika’s curl cream should be used with caution, but once you figure out the right amount for your hair, you might never use anything else. The cream contains oat peptide, which is meant to lock in moisture and increase the shine of your hair. When used on wet hair, this curl cream will allow your curls to form in their natural shape yet still allows for bounce, which is a rarity to be sure. That said, use this with caution if you have thinner or finer hair; a little bit goes a long way and, once you’ve stepped over that line, it can feel greasy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6.7 fl oz | <strong>Hydrating Ingredients: </strong>Tapioca Starch, Oat Peptide, Sea Buckthorn Berry | <strong>Sulfate Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-coily-hair-melanin-haircare-twist-elongating-style-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Coily Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Melanin Haircare Twist-Elongating Style Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="Melanin Haircare Twist Elongating Style Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ohtionnpHxTmFR6VsLk6qp-Pz0I=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MelaninHaircareTwistElongatingStyleCream-ba6de5d73e4e49ca963938e05a8b61d8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It’s buildable.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: It can be too heavy for thin hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Melanin Haircare was founded by two sisters who shared a passion for natural hair care and safe ingredients. And, if you have coily hair, you know how difficult it can be to properly hydrate your strands, while maintaining volume and still feeling light.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Melanin Haircare has come to the rescue with their super lightweight curl cream that is both intensely moisturizing (a must with curls of any kind!), but buildable at the same time, so you can start off slow and add more product as desired without the stress of going over-the-top. This curl cream includes five of the most nourishing hair butters: shea, mango, cocoa, kokum, and cupuacu, to which aloe vera, avocado, almond oil, and argan oil is added. To use this cream, add a little to wet hair and let it dry naturally, adding more product as needed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>16.1 fl oz | <strong>Hydrating Ingredients: </strong>Aloe Vera, Castor Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil | <strong>Sulfate Free: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-briogeo-curl-charisma-silicone-free-curly-hair-care-travel-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Travel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Briogeo Briogeo Curly Hair Care Travel Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1036 data-sizes=750px alt="Briogeo Curl Charisma Silicone-Free Curly Hair Care Travel Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xi93l0hlnKF3Sfw4KYysJLnrWcc=/fit-in/1500x1036/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ScreenShot2022-07-19at5.08.05PM-f23b4491fa614fd1a02bbbbeea8f8a5a.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It comes with not one, but four, travel-friendly tubes.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: Though TSA-friendly, these 2 oz tubes run out quickly, so you might have to pack more than one for your next getaway.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re a jet-setter who doesn’t want to settle when it comes to taking her product on the go, this is the set for you. Frankly, if we hadn’t wanted to highlight Briogeo’s awesome travel-friendly pack, the larger-sized curl cream by the brand would definitely have made the list all on its own. This cream uses rice amino acids to defrizz, locking out environmental moisture that causes frizz (like humidity!). With avocado oil for shine and quinoa extract to define your newly-moisture curls, it’s a trifecta of active ingredients that make this curl cream top of our list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What’s more, they offer a travel set of small 2 oz tubes that are TSA-friendly and package them in a set of four — shampoo and conditioner, curl cream, and a mask.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>Four 2 oz tubes | <strong>Hydrating Ingredients: </strong>Rice Amino Acids, Tomato Fruit Ferment, Avocado Oil, Castor Oil, Chia Seed Oil, and Flax Seed Oil | <strong>Sulfate Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-all-hair-types-moroccanoil-curl-defining-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for All Hair Types</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7NShlUh1cHKxvLDH4kW2gp-5JFc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/moroccanoil-curl-defining-cream-dc078a814ac94d4ebe9fd77979687fbf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It’s ultra-moisturizing without feeling heavy.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: The scent is a bit too strong for some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Moroccanoil products are known for their argan oil infusion, which is meant to moisturize and condition due to its high concentration of Vitamin E, essential fatty acids, and antioxidants. As such, this product is not one that boasts hold. What it will do, however, is define the curls you already have, be they small waves or tight corkscrews. It’s rare to find a product that is equally beloved between all hair types, though you will surely need to use more on thicker hair and less on thinner, this product is lightweight enough for you and all your curly-haired friends to use together. It does, however, boast a signature scent that is quite perfumey, which is definitely polarizing: while some users love it, others feel it is too overwhelming.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As an added benefit, while this product surely works on air-dried hair, it features a heat-activated technology that will keep your curls bouncy if you use a blow-dryer or diffuser on the low-setting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2.5, 8.5 fl oz | <strong>Hydrating Ingredients: </strong>Argan Oil, Polyquaternium-11, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein | <strong>Sulfate Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-oribe-curl-control-silkening-creme></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Oribe Curl Control Silkening Creme</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="Oribe Curl Control Silkening Creme" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EpSaJL1TxTPFQ-egVzjCTu7NM_A=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/OribeCurlControlSilkeningCreme-0d5603c279c94209b10f8e93264ca671.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A little bit goes a long way, making the product last longer than others.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: This cream is a little too heavy for thin hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, this curl cream runs on the more expensive side than most, but since a small amount is all you need, it might very well last you longer than other tubes of the same size. Regardless, it’s also totally worth the hype. Best for medium to thick hair, Oribe pays particular attention to the feel of your curls. Not only does this product cut down on frizz and define your mass of curls, but there’s a reason that it’s called “silkening” cream, as your hair will literally feel like silk when you’re done.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jenna Spino, Stylist at Maxine Salon in Chicago, swears by Oribe’s curl cream. Of the product she shares, “it’s a lightweight cream that will give curls definition, provide hold, and reduce frizz without feeling sticky or crunchy.” Adding, “This cream gives hold while still moisturizing the hair using ingredients such as avocado oil, apricot oil, and coconut oil.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5 oz | <strong>Hydrating Ingredients: </strong>Coconut Oil, Avocado Oil, Apricot Oil, Jojoba Oil, Argan Oil, Blend of Styling Polymers, Oribe Signature Complex (Watermelon, Lychee, and Edelweiss Flower) | <strong>Sulfate Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-customizable-prose-custom-curl-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Customizable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Prose Custom Curl Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="Prose Custom Curl Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5Ef1ujMzlA4oEDpCWz_Z0umUnAA=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ProseCustomCurlCream-1e79a0c3479f4442a23877244a28b554.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Prose</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: The company crafts a special formula based on your specific needs.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: It is only shoppable from the brand itself, due to its personalized nature.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Everyone’s hair is different. And, while the easiest way to shop is to walk into your local Sephora and pick up a curl cream that you think is aimed at hair kind-of-sort-of like yours, there’s nothing quite like a custom formula to really capture all of your desires. On the Prose website, you are walked through a number of questions about your hair, ranging from your age to curl shape; moisture level, density, and even porosity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But don’t worry, no matter how daunting some of the questions might be, there are options to either view visuals or have the question explained to you every step of the way. They even go as far as to tell you what is most affecting your hair where you live (I, in NYC, am most affected by UV rays, water hardness, humidity, and pollution), so that “even the weather can’t ruin your hair,” according to their website. At the very end you get to choose your fragrance, be it floral, fresh herbal, musky, or more (fragrance-free is also an option).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At the end of the process, you are given not only a custom curl cream, but a whole ritual if you’d like, complete with shampoo, conditioner, masks, supplements, and more. But, for the purposes of this list, let’s focus on the curl cream. It will target all the basics of a curl cream (think: frizz, definition, moisture, etc), but will also have added ingredients to help with a myriad of other issues that might have been brought up throughout your personalized survey. Does it get any better than that?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5.1 fl oz | <strong>Hydrating Ingredients: </strong>Changes based on your unique formula | <strong>Sulfate Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-damaged-hair-sheamoisture-coconut--hibiscus-curl-enhancing-smoothie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Damaged Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SheaMoisture Coconut &amp;amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kCCfZ8SWbemVker6kUHlxtOvEcs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sheamoisture-coconut--hibiscus-curl-enhancing-smoothie-46ceafbadf7f47de9caecd2dd42c0091.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: Not only does it enhance your curls, but it adds noticeable shine.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love</strong>: Its scent is great, but strong, and can stand in competition with others that you wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, everyone can benefit from a little moisture infusion in their curls, but this product works magic on previously damaged hair as well. After chemical treatments, color changes, even regular heat styling, you are often left with dry, brittle strands that are a shell of their former selves. This curl cream will bring your curls back to life, not only giving them a moisturizing lift while you’re wearing the product, but aiding in the strengthening and healing of your hair over time. Comb a tiny amount through wet hair, then hands off, you’ll be left with air-dried curls that will amaze you. And for problem areas that hold frizz in low regard, like baby hairs and flyaways, try an extra dab of curl cream directly to those spots to tame.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>12 oz | <strong>Hydrating Ingredients: </strong>Coconut Oil, Neem Oil, Shea Butter | <strong>Sulfate Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-marc-anthony-strictly-curls-curl-envy-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Cream, 6 fl oz" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/l29j2l8V7KEh5HT0DrHWAOjxLzg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/marc-anthony-strictly-curls-curl-cream-6-fl-oz-7963a48817ba4945a23337ac873cff51.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rite Aid</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It’s easy to find at the drugstore.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: It might be too heavy for some.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is a fan favorite amongst drugstore shoppers with curls.

Check the packaging and make sure that you’re either choosing a fragrance-free option, or one with a scent that you actually like. Hair retains a ton of smell (pro tip: spray perfume in your hair for a more long-lasting fragrance every day), so whatever product you use is going to stick around.

I like to use prayer hands: a prayer motion with the hair in-between the hands, sliding down each section, to ensure the cream distributes evenly. I also find it best to scrunch up each section at the end to help maintain the curls' natural shape,” Batalle recommends.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What order should you apply curl cream?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your best bet is to apply your curl cream right after you step out of the shower, when your hair is pretty wet. This is because wet hair allows the curl cream to easily glide through your strands and define each curl. Once all your hair is coated with the curl cream, it’ll help to lock in the moisture and hydration, so your curls look more defined, bouncy, and frizz-free.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Daley Quinn </a>is a freelance writer, specializing in beauty and health, who has contributed to numerous publications, such as Elle, Real Simple, Allure, The Cut, WWD, and more.
