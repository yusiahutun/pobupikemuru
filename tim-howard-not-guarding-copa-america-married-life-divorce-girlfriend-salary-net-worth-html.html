Well, is he still the no.1 in the US squad? Or is there someone else obstructing him?&nbsp;</p><h2>Howard’s Dip in Form sees him out of the starting XI in Copa America 2016</h2><p>There came&nbsp;a huge disappointment for the US football fans who wanted to repeat&nbsp;their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2014 World Cup memories.</a> Yes, people who hoped&nbsp;to refresh&nbsp;their memories with Howard, got a devastating sad news. Tim Howard did not start&nbsp;between the posts for the US national side this time. He was&nbsp;on the squad but had to&nbsp;stay as a backup to the selected shot-stopper Brad Guzan.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/Tim%20Howard%20with%20wife.jpg></p><p>Howard is also surrounded by great pressure as he struggles to find his form in Everton FC. His save percentage tallied at the last (59.26%) out of the 29 goalkeepers who made six or more Premier League starts in the 2015/16 season. Howard’s poor run of form affected Everton FC, as they struggled in the league and eventually finished 11th on the table. Here, have detailed information on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Howard’s dip in form.</a></p><p>The US national team manager, Jurgen Klinsmann says that Howard has been kept as a backup to Guzan because he took almost one year gap from the national side. To regain his position, he has to fight from the bottom level, adds the manager.</p><p>He also told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">MLS Soccer</a>, “Tim Howard finished a huge, huge chapter with Everton Football Club. He’s always going to be a legend for Everton, and he did wonderful things with that club. But he wasn’t with us for a year after the World Cup, and he also lost his starting spot the last half of the year with Everton, so we think that in that moment, Brad has a little bit of an edge and deserves it.”</p><p>Even though Howard was not selected for the starting XI, he has no hard feelings for Brad Guzan. He has told ESPN that the two of them will always remain close friends, and he will keep supporting Guzan all the time.</p><p>“I’ve always said that if you could build a goalkeeper and you could take this guy’s hands, this keeper’s feet, the brain would be Brad’s. His mental strength and fortitude are better than anyone I’ve ever seen. He can, even in the midst of chaos, to shrug things off and not in a flippant way. For me, he’s the best goalkeeping mind I’ve ever been around.”</p><p>(Statement recorded as Howard told to ESPN)</p><h2>Tim Howard or Brad Guzan?</h2><p>I have analyzed some statistical comparison between Tim Howard and Brad Guzan.&nbsp;</p><p>For a goalkeeper, the most basic stats, apart from the clean sheet, is the save percentage. A keeper's strong point is determined by how often he avoids the ball from kissing the net behind him. In this category, Brad Guzan edges Howard. Guzan is also an expert on parrying the ball out of the danger zone more often, and he also has allowed fewer rebounds (23) than Tim Howard (25) in the Premier League. However, Howard is a better expertise in catching the ball and goal handling. He is also better than Guzan with his feet.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's have a look at the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Stats Comparison</a> between the two.</p><p>Despite going through series of bad lucks on the field, Howard's personal life is going on smoothly.

A 6ft 3 inch (1.91m) height has also been a perfect fit for him to be a goalkeeper. Going by the name ‘Tim Howard’ in the footballing world, he is currently playing for the English Premier League team Everton FC, and will be joining the American football club, MLS Colorado Rapids after the international fixtures complete.</p><h3>Howard’s Footballing History</h3><h2>Club Career</h2><p>Tim Howard had the first game in his football career with the North Jersey Imperials.

With Howard in their squad, United won the 2003 FA Community Shield, 2003-04 FA Cup and the League Cup of 2005-06.</p><p>But even with these trophies, Howard could not stay with United for long. After the signing of the Dutch goalkeeper, Edwin Van Der Saar (who in years that followed, proved to be a United Legend), Tim had to leave United on a loan spell at Everton in search of more first-team game time.
