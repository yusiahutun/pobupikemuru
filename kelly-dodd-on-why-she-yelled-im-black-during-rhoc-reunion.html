&#34;Real Housewives of Orange County&#34; star Kelly Dodd found herself having to explain a sound bite once again after a clip for the upcoming reunion episode was released.
In it, Shannon Beador claimed a co-star called her &#34;racist&#34; and a &#34;homophobe&#34; as Dodd appeared to fire back by yelling, &#34;I'm Black!&#34;

"She's always saying that I'm a racist or a homophobe and it really irritates me. So I did a '23andMe' and I don't identify myself as a Black person, that was not my point. My point was I'm Black, Asian, Mexican, Spanish, I'm 30% Native American and I'm one percent Jewish. And I'm all races."</p><p>"I don't see people with color, I see people. That's it."</p><p>In an earlier interview with the outlet, Dodd also clarified her side of the <a href=#>heated exchange she had with host Andy Cohen</a> over COVID and politics on last week's reunion episode.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f9c99476-680d-4c4e-b466-6368b34bdd2f data-container-ref=toofab:article:eb405cc5-7f0b-4ee7-b47a-4d4759a7b921 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b3/5by4/2021/01/20/b3341c3497a74914bfa168583464259d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">RHOC Reunion: Shannon Claims Braunwyn Offered 14-Year-Old Daughter 'the Good Stuff'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I mean, the amount of messages that I get that you're uneducated, you're putting out misinformation, you're behaving like a moron ..." Cohen said on the show, before Dodd turned the tables.</p><p>"I get them too, saying that you're anti-American, that you put your political beliefs out there, that they don't want to watch a political show," she shot back. "I'm anti-American because I don't like Donald Trump?" asked an incredulous Cohen. "Yeah," said Dodd.</p><p>She explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!</a>, "My point with Andy was that you can always find negative comments on social media. Some people with zero posts and zero followers comment, but the vast majority of comments about me are positive."</p><p>"And my point was that just because people come to me and say he's anti-American doesn't mean he is," she continued. "It's not that he's anti-American, I don't think he's anti-American at all. But I get people that DM me that say that, doesn't mean it's true. That's what I meant."</p><p>The "RHOC" reunion will continue next Wednesday on Bravo.</p><a id=gallery-link-20d4df82-bd26-4f8a-bd89-a0ec55aa1011 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:20d4df82-bd26-4f8a-bd89-a0ec55aa1011 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:eb405cc5-7f0b-4ee7-b47a-4d4759a7b921 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8e/4by3/2021/01/18/8e84473f204a4f7c8952c3a69a0635d5_md.png width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j2pma2pfoLKtuNhmm6iclGK8r3nWobBmq5iaerqxy6WcnWWZonqjuMCcomacpae2r7OMq5%2Bom12nsra6yKilaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
