Police said Siskaee was arrested last week after ignoring two previous summonses for questioning. Her lawyer protested against the arrest, arguing Sisakee had lodged a pre-trial motion at the South Jakarta District Court questioning the legality of her status as a suspect.
“The police should have waited for the verdict of the court before making the arrest,” said Siskaee’s lawyer, Tofan Agung Ginting."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Between 2016 and 2023, the country’s Ministry of Communications and Informatics blocked access to 1.9 million websites with adult content, including popular general interest platforms such as Reddit and Vimeo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A 2021 government study claimed 66.6 per cent of young men and 62.3 per cent of young women in Indonesia had “seen sexual acts online”, creating a moral panic within the country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The following year, authorities categorised “porn addiction” in the country as “having entered a critical stage” and required “government intervention to bring it under control”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In May 2023, Anwar Abbas, deputy chairman of Indonesian Ulema Council, the country’s highest Islamic clerical body, urged authorities to step up their efforts in combating “lewdness” on the internet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We must take a firm approach in order to save the future of our children from immorality and debauchery,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/29/e507493a-11ed-40c3-94d2-1180f99a8549_7ebb6432.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But not all Islamic leaders take such a hardline approach. Progressive cleric and pluralism activist Aan Anshori said he was saddened by the “lack of maturity” among Indonesians in recognising “the need for adult entertainment”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Unfortunately in Indonesia, religiosity is often equated with puritanism when it comes to sex and sexuality, rendering both subjects as taboos, including pornography,” said Anshori, better known as Gus Aan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The mindset of sex as an evil thing reviled by religion had encouraged the state and law enforcement agencies to feel the need to “prove their diligence” in tackling porn, Gus Aan noted, adding that it resulted in a sense of overkill in how Indonesian authorities dealt with sex-related cases.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The impression given remains that they try to pander to public opinion and the religious establishment about sexual morality,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gus Aan called on Indonesian religious leaders to lead the way in moderating the nation’s “obsessive” stigmatisation of anything sexual, saying the emphasis should be on how “coercive, non-consensual, manipulative and exploitative” sexual acts were wrong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/29/c8a86dae-6bdb-40f4-b48a-ccb14db8447c_5a203898.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indonesia’s anti-pornography statutes are not only repressive but dangerous to sexual violence victims, argues social media influencer Indah G, who says the laws are in dire need of “technical upgrades to catch up with the times”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the digital age, many women find themselves victims of unauthorised distribution of their nude images, be it in cases of non-consensual intimate imagery [revenge porn] or blackmail,” said the creator and host of The Indah G Show.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Indah G, under the current law, women victimised through pornography are categorised as parties to criminal acts. “Where is the justice in that?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In April 2020, a 20-year-old woman was sentenced to three years and three months in jail after appearing in a group sex video clip that went viral on social media. Two of the male actors in the clip, however, received a lighter jail term of two years and nine months.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The woman, who claimed she had been coerced into taking part by her former husband and that she had been unaware it was being filmed, filed a petition with the constitutional court for a judicial review. It was later rejected by the court.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Deepfake porn images of Taylor Swift have gone viral.
