From Oct. 3 to Nov. 2 Stapleton played the final 13 shows on the tour, which were all sold out. The total gross from these shows was a whopping $13.5 million, with 169,290 tickets sold. Stapleton's 2019 tour in its entirety grossed $30.9 million with 417,604 tickets sold.</p><p>Stapleton's first show was on Jul. 9 at the&nbsp;Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Md., while his final show was on Nov. 2 at the&nbsp;KFC Yum! Center in Louisville, Ky. The "Nobody to Blame" singer earned his highest grossing night of the tour when he played to&nbsp;15,748 people in Louisville, which earned him&nbsp;$1.395 million.</p><p>The country singer's tour was relatively short, having played 33 shows in 33 markets across the U.S. However, Stapleton made up for the shorter tour by landing in maximum-capacity arenas and&nbsp;amphitheaters in the cities that he visited. His previous tours in 2017 and 2018 played to smaller, more intimate venues, where Stapleton doubled up his appearances.</p><p>With each tour that Stapleton has embarked on, his earnings have steadily increased. In 2017 the country singer earned an average of&nbsp;$637,000 per night; while the next year in 2018 he earned&nbsp;$903,000 per night, and this year he earned&nbsp;$937,000 per night according to <a href=#>Billboard</a>.</p><p>Across Stapleton's tour dates the singer played some <a href=#>new music</a> including the unreleased song "<a href=#>Starting Over</a>," which he played during a tour stop in Florida. Stapleton has not announced any upcoming new releases as of now.</p><p><strong>See the Top 10 Country Songs of 2019:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnKCinsBuv9Oap6WdpKS7bn%2BPZnBmpZmhuaq7zWarqK2iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
